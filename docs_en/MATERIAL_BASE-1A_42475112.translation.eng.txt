lady destroys boyfriend's property
a guy from this area is counting losses after his girlfriend destroyed household items worth a fortune when she found him having fun with another woman at a club.
rumors say that the guy had known that wonderfully beautiful lady for the last two years and they became lovers.
after knowing each other, the two started a relationship and started visiting each other frequently.
later their relationship solidified and they decided to get married and started the wedding preparations.
"unluckily, the guy is not the type of person to be content with one woman and has several other lovers though his girlfriend does not know," said the source.
however, his forty days came to pass at the end of the week, when the guy came from work and as usual joined his friends to relax at a club that had organized music entertainment.
unfortunately, his girlfriend had earlier planned with her brothers to meet in order to make plans that our source did not elaborate.
the surprising thing is that they decided to meet at the club where the guy was relaxing with his friends, but he was not aware.
just as soon as the lady entered the club famous for organizing entertainment concerts known as Mugithi Nite, she saw her boyfriend embracing a lady as they passionately kissed in public.
seeing that, the lady was incensed, she went to the guy and confronted him, "so this is how things are," yelled the pretty lady.
"if you think I'm a person to be shared with club sluts then you'll see since today you'll know and you yourself will regret," said the lady.
according to a source, the pretty lady went out and boarded a motorcycle up to the guy's home, where she took a club and in anger broke electronic and furniture items and caused such a loss that the guy will never forget in his life.
it was not immediately discerned if the pair were reunited after the incident.
