Menina: "I cannot give sex bribes so that I can be artist".
the musician who emerged in the Epiq Bongo Star Search 2012 competition, Menina Atick has said despite of hearing that there are men with position in the 'game' of music who ask for sex bribery from the female artist so they they can produce them, she will mature and believes she will stand.
while speaking on Friday recently, Menina who is causing discomfort with her song of Shaghala Baghala said that whatever she believes is that a female artist who has a talent even she does not offer sex bribery, she has an opportunity to shine therefore she will be an example to others.
"me to give sex bribery so that I can go, truly it is not possible, I believe on myself, I will not agree to use my body by sharing love so that I can stand in music, first, with how many I will walk?" argued that artist.
