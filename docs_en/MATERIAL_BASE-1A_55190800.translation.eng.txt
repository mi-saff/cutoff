Facebook is asking for forgiveness from its users.
the social network Facebook has been forced to ask for forgiveness from its users after sending the message about identifying situation after a blast occurred in Lahore, Pakistan.
Facebook through its Safety Check service where, if there's an unsafe occurrence in an area that has internet users, will send messages to inform close relatives the state of the user in that region if they're safe.
after the explosion of the bomb where approximately 70 people lost their lives, Facebook sent a message saying you are safe to people who were far away from that area, "it seems you are in the area affected by explosions in Gulshan-i-Iqbal Park, Lahore, Pakistan.
report to your friends so that they can know that you are safe."
after recognizing that there was a problem, it was necessary to apologize to those who received that message.
unfortunately, a lot of people who had not been affected by the chaos (Pakistan) received the message asking them if they were safe, the problem that has risen was not intentional.
we are working on it very fast so that that problem can be fixed, said the report from Facebook
