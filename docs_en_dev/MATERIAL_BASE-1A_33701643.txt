The presence of the presence of the general elections of the Tanzania Football Federation (TFF) that is expected to take place in August this year is caused by some of the analysis of soccer issues in the country to be one of something that makes a lot of pain at the moment.

He wanted to go back to some leaders and other leaders to want to get into power, it has made leaders that are in power right now, forgetting their responsibilities because we expect to focus in campaigns to defend their seats.

This is the one that performed football in making sure that every leader in power is looking at how he will be part of the leaders in the next season.

These events that we continue to see it is because of lack of good leadership that would be able to prepare well and supervise the ball themselves so as to avoid the situation that is happening as if the senior leaders do not care about who is happening and what is going to care!

If we expect we have been done here, we have no doubt that the TFF leaders have passed away and they are running themselves as they want.

While the leadership of Jamal Malinzi, following the trap, the problems are continued to increase and every month will end one month to another month which even the problems are rarely on month to end without any problem inside our football.

What is needed is to be said to be said that the leaders themselves have been trying to meet with stakeholders to address the challenges, instead the leaders are supposed to be heard, but stakeholders are supposed to be heard, but stakeholders are supposed to be heard. I believe if we can buy one house and then we can stop over poles.

Achileus of all the previous problems in the past, the issue of Simba and Kagera Sugar has been able to get three points, an issue that makes the news headlines, although yesterday issue was expected to be released his decisions.

This issue has been bad and to do up to people from different soccer institutions to intervene in the middle and others see the eyes of the eyes, but the size of this issue has been unable to manage their regulations and instead of the issue to move to the will of private individuals.

The regulations of the Tanzania Mainland Premier League (TPLB) is clear that if it is known as a player has played a three yellow card, in a few games, it is not allowed to play in the following game while playing with that card that is known as well as a player that is believed to make the people be careful.

The report of the referee is the last decision of believing that every event is different from the ethics of the soccer game, it does not loose a card in his team's game against African Lyon, but a player has shown that he was not given a card for that day.

After the 72-hour committee of the law and friends of players about that issue, it comes up until the report of the referee is supposed to be heard since our ball were called up to African Lyon that was played with Kagera Sugar, went to understand the report of the referee we will believe the reports of the referee we believe in reports of what person we believe in another person?

For government together, went, African Lyon and brought him in front of the referees is to look for the evidence of violence that cannot cross the right time for the report of the concerned game. TFF and his committee stopped him on this issue by using one report so that everyone returns from the economic development of Tanzania.

It's only Tanzania where you can meet this situation and protect themselves they do not care so much, but despite this situation it is now time for TFF and its committee to view some of its regulations and leave the team to get a table.

It gets a good flavor artist for the team that gave every team that they have for winning in the field and later they are coming into the victory of TFF and its committee to meet with a fine, but the teams that were unable to meet their victory.

In this, the members of Simba and their fans have been priority to say that even the youth squad "Serengeti Boys" is going in Gabon because of the table, but those people were supposed to know the appeal of TFF for the youth team to Tanzania Football Federation (CAF) and its committees are from two different appeal.

The national youth team of Congo DR Congo broke lack of losing to a player who is big "that will take them" and the punishment for this way is open from CAF that is why we did not see the noise from the fans of Congo DR Congo had already made mistakes and they used the punishment to be removed but not Kagera Sugar has denied their victory.

The issue of Simba, Kagera Sugar needs a wisdom of that was written by the referees of Kagera Sugar and African Lyon, all other things we will be informed if the player was given a card or don't know it, we believe that their reports are not true.
