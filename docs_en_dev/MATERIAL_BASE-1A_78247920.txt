Tanzania Meteorological Authority (TMA), has launched a new way to provide its information on climate change, to pave way for citizens through the Vodacom network.
The Executive Director of TMA, Doctor Agnes Kijazi, said that in Dar es Salaam yesterday when speaking to the press.

"Tanzania is big and the weather in many areas it happens, sometimes the ways that are used to give the information did not involve all the people on time, therefore the mobile phones is better, a big percentage of the mobile phone," said Doctor Kijazi.

He added that those reports will be realized in Swahili and English which shows the weather in eternal peace, wind, and shivered to the sea in all provinces in the country.

He said that the authority has used to use opportunities of technology available so as to make sure they are given information on climate change every time they need.

On his side, the head of communications and marketing of Vodacom, Mister Kelvin Twissa, said that service will involve the customers of Vodacom network.

"The customer of Vodacom will be required to send a short message of words in the number + 88 and will cost shillings 100 shillings for every report," said Mister Twissa.

He urged our agents to use that opportunity to get information on the weather, building a culture of looking for and getting information.
