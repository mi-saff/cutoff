What happened the small elections gave the value of Francis Nyalile in the grave.
February 27, 2014, President of the second phase, Ali Hassan Mwinyi was appointed the president's commission to make research and get answers about the requirements of our political parties or remain in the system of one party.
The commission was led by the former chief justice of Tanzania, Francis Nyalile and he did work for a whole year, February 17, 1992, President Mwinyi was given a report about the opinion and recommendations of the citizens about the system of many parties or one.
The answers that were given by the commission of Judge Damian Lubuva is that the system of many political parties was accepted by 80 percent, because that is 20 percent only, the ones being ready for political parties.
We shall begin in large numbers they were not ready for many parties' system and it's not because they did not love me, except they were asked something that he didn't know and they were not understanding about its benefits.
The report of the National Electoral Commission, shows that the introduction of a lot of political parties in the year 1992, successful by forcing a few people with strength who saw the importance of politics of many parties in promoting democracy, killed and many who tried.
The national father of the nation, Mwalimu Julius Nyerere was one of the people on the front line to enable the nation to deal with one party's system and welcoming many political parties.
Even in CCM, they told the Mwalimu Nyerere when he addressed many parties of the country, according to many parties, according to many political parties, there are many people not knowing the importance of many political parties.
The election results on January 22, this year, will take a small elections for parliamentary seat in the constituency of Dfaith, Zanzibar and 19 wards in Tanzania mainland to fill the positions that were open from different reasons.
The Revolutionary Party (CCM) got great success by winning the parliamentary seat in parliament and won 19 wards, while the Party for Democracy and Development (CHADEMA) goes up to one area which is one in Babati, Manyara Province.
What has happened in that small elections is the one that has helped me the retired Judge Nyalile in the top position, because it has continued to show that true they will benefit from 80 percent they were not ready for many parties.
It has been 25 years since the commission of Judge Damian Lubuva has handed over President Mwinyi's report, so this is the 25th year, since the system of many political parties that are allowed to curb the voice of a few parties.
In its 25 year, it is obvious that even the commission of Judge Nyalile in his research now, maybe the answers were that they were 20 percent only that they would send many parties.
The results of the elections in the 19 wards of Tanzania Mainland, didn't even little the results of the general election 2015 which has approximately 40 percent of the opposition parties for the presidency and members of parliament.
Those results are not successful even with the number of opposition members who are in the moment, 32 percent of the election results have shown CCM to win by 9521 percent while the opposition has killed 48 percent.
On that logic, 25 years after the introduction of a lot of political parties, the situation is so bad to the opposition parties because it seems to have a hard work of going towards the general elections in 2020 because it was between the year 2010 to 2015.
Responding to the opposition to 25 years since Judge Damian Lubuva, when they gave reports of his commission, the results have shown that the great problem which aims at difficult state of opposition parties in the country is the absence of implementation of the system themselves.
The reason of lack of opinions of the system of many political parties is or people not to see the benefits of the system themselves or to know that it is unknown.
What happens during the repeat election in general, it shows that people do not know the benefits of many parties and they are not ready to accept it, the real situation has shown that many parties' system is not friendly in Tanzania politics.
Lack of friendship is because of many conflicts emerging at the election time, a situation was not supposed to attract in the small elections of 19 wards and only one region has brought in large numbers, how would you were if the elections had already benefited though five constituencies?
And faith in Zanzibar, the situation was bad and there are complaints that agents of candidates for opposition parties, CUF, ACT-Wazalendo and CHAUMMA Party were given out and the supervisors of the election in some of the stations.
The reason of the occurrence is claims of the presence of several errors like the existence of two votes for the voters, the existence of the voters whose legality had not been faced with pictures of the voters while they were requesting the agents to receive from outside.
A small elections in one region and 19 wards was caused by the bomb attacks to be used by other nations in various parts of the country it was reported to have a tension between the police and the voters of different parties, it is still a challenge and it does not concern them through the system of many political parties which are usually caused by the amount of two political parties.
The meaning of the citizens depend on how the system themselves touched by the law of the country, when a system of many parties seems to be careful with the dollar, there will see citizens fear the difference with two hands.
When it comes up to support the opposition parties it's same as a great opponent, even if the people will love me, to the opposition parties, they will not fear just.
It is a must that opposition parties to have a friend of dollars and their friendship itself they want leaders of the opposition parties to see they are free in partnership with the state agencies according to the law of the country and the agencies so that the opponents are not enemies.
The system of many political parties is for the purpose of making a democratic elections in the general elections to be careful.
Instead of one party to stop two people and then one who will get a lot of votes is the winner, there will be many parties that have stopped the candidates with different qualifications, then they are building for votes that are free to choose what will be independent.
Many parties system was accepted by the constitution of the United Republic of Tanzania together with the government of Zanzibar and therefore, it is a system that same way.
The contributing parties are supposed to get into elections get married, have the same strength to participation including conflicts and violence is participating in a problem of lack traditions.
That state's rule without caring between the parties participating in the election and a conflict of dollars against the opposition parties, have shown the rights not to grow.
People have given up the results of the overall results have shown that in 19 wards that were involved in the small elections in Tanzania Mainland, the number of voters had reduced, compared to it was in the general elections of 2015.
For example, one of the Indian Ocean in Dar es Salaam which his voters was reduced by more than two-thirds from the year the day before yesterday and the situation has taken place in different areas that brought the small elections.
In the year 2015, voters were 290, and the elections on January 22, this year, those affected by 274 Tanzanian shillings as it takes a total of 2774% on that meaning, 676 percent of those who played last weekend.
Together with the CCM political parties, ACT Patriots Party and CUF are seen to have a good campaign to encourage citizens, still people do not come out in the good number of voters have reduced instead of increasing.
The reduction of the number of voters in his way is to get up, that they did not have their expectations in voting.
