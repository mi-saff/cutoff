Serengeti National Hospital, a resident of Magubike village in the district of Mara region, Christopher Nyamgenda, has been questioned on the accusations of giving false information to one delegate who was requested for sex information to get loans from the National Social Security Fund (NSSF).
He gave those allegations in a public meeting that took place in Rahaleo primary school in front of the head of Mara Province, Magesa Mulongo.
Before his arrest, Nyamgenda, who was with an error in the phones, claimed that they don't have money to be able to cater for them through buying money and NSSF in Mara Province.
"The provincial commissioner has completed the registration criteria, after donating more than 11 million shillings, giving education on how to run and later on an opportunity to inform us if we want to follow up loans, we want them to follow up," claimed Nyamajaj.
At the time the Provincial Commissioner was announced by those allegations, he stopped one woman of that village and was unable to ask for women on his false information that is aimed at hiding them.
When Mulongo instructed the police commander in that district to put Nyamitwe, Yagi, and urged the police officers for the allegations of getting in the area, he said that sitting aimed at discussing the problems and not otherwise.
