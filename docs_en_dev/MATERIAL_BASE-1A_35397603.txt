141 schools from Turner in South Africa, Turki and Turky (middle) have received a food that is supervised by the cross-sex organization in the country.
The chief officer of that organization, Turner Mister Nicodemus Thom said that those schools have never been receiving any donation of food.
"This has caused many children to remain at home while also known as food is difficult to have education in the school," said Mister Feruzi.
The officer was speaking yesterday when he launched the program which will take a three months in nursery school of the mountains in South Sudan.
"We have risen to 100 kilograms of maize, 30 tons of rice, 3 tons of cooking oil and 2000 for salt and make sure that every school has got its equal share." Said Mister.

He urged the teachers in those schools to ensure food has been used well so that they do not tire us for a long time.
