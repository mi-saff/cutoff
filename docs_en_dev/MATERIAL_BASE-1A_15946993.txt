Politics have forgotten the danger of El Nino.
Sei 30, 2015.

How do we take advantage of the heavy rains, El Nino rains which are expected to start living in the next month can explain why our ability to fight the disaster is small and it is clear that we are not supposed to do the wall but we should not be careful.
I have followed up the advertisements for television and radio stations in Kenya and discovered that our colleagues have already started to take various actions of fighting or to reduce the effects that are expected to arise from the East African countries starting from the second time in October.
First, already El Nino in a big agenda in Kenya, will be discussed at the media and social media stations every day, while the government is giving a report of what the citizens are expected to work together according to the World Bank and the European Union promised to give 10 billion shillings.
Some of the regions have begun to do meetings and citizens in their areas to educate them on how to fight with El Nino in the National Housing Corporation (NAPA- C), they have organized to provide information professionally, education and coordination for the main government and states before those rains and after those rains.
However, the most important thing is that the various government authorities of Kenya in the cities, especially Nairobi have begun to encourage citizens to do that activity in their estates and to be able to encourage citizens to do that activity in their estates.
The constituencies in the provinces have already planned to relocate people in the valley areas that are expected affected by the rains and special areas of involving people who were affected by people that they are asked, they are not getting safe at home.
In the plans of dealing with El Nino, Kenyans have arrested 70,000 people, the reserve army (an example of JKT) to address any operation of getting access to infrastructure as well as food and tourism, it is expected that those rains can increase their crops on the internet and to strengthen the tourists that are warned that they are encouraged to come to these areas in that period.
Kenyans have also begun to think how they can change the situation as the grace of getting water, which otherwise will be paid for free in the ocean as an advice that has been given because of various cities to be done, but at all people they talk.
We do not know if the news media I will visit to look for information is not correct, then I have never heard about, then we will not see if we will not be keen, Magufuli or Lowassa, CCM or Ukawa.
In Kenya where the debate on dealing with El Nino are many and has been given great weight to the media, it's not that they do not have political issues and shook the country at the moment in Kenya is facing a shortage of teachers in the whole country who claim that it does not have money to pay the teachers.
As it is not enough, the opposition party in Kenya of President Uhuru Kenyatta led by Raila Odinga, they have started paying the issue of strike under a political move, while they used them to start a step to dismiss him to the president.
But in addition to all that, Kenyans know that their lives and development of the country are important and therefore they don't know that they have a responsibility to protect their lives, which without any human being, can do more to be buried and have never been buried and we have never been identified.
