Yanga who did not have a secretary who does not benefit?
Dec 4th, 2014.

There was a time I ever said through my one in this newspaper that, so as to ensure that you be a leader in Simba and Yanga clubs to have a certain behavior.

I would like some of those behaviors like having a whip, and someone to give numerous promises, when you want to contest for different positions, even if you know that there is no good environment for enable them to implement those promise.

This situation was there in the old clubs in that era, there is now and it will continue to be there if the whole system of leading Simba and Yanga will not be stopped.

The big problem in this club is relying on the decision which had been done by members, or through the sessions with official meetings or not officially.

There is a time it is obvious that some of the members of these clubs are for the purpose of their interests and not for the interests of those clubs. For example there have been groups in these clubs where all the days enabled conflicts and not during development plans.

This system of these clubs who has been forced, there is a possibility of taking them to your club more than here where history shows that Simba and Yanga soccer club has dropped for a long time in the premier league and shows a couple that has caused the teams to have many lovers.

There is no foundation that took place on investment side in the soccer of this country, more than various leaders who have been entering power to have ghost plans.

Perhaps, this situation is funded by recently after the members of those clubs who are happy to check up and not apart from the great reputation of these clubs is raising conflicts from time to members until the leadership.

At the end of last week, there was a report of the former secretary general of Yanga, Beno Njovu of the level, but more reports are saying that he has completed his term, according to the contract that were with him by that club.

There is no one who refused that Njovu of Parliament did not complete his term, but the way that was used to release the level to be announced through the media is the one that fell.

Njovu of parliament who came in power in January this year, taking the position of Lawrence Mwaluka, found himself leaving in power in the same style that he met Mwalyanzi to make three permanent secretaries within 15 months.

Before Mwaluka was also there, Celestine Mwesigwa, who is now the secretary general of Tanzania Football Federation (TFF), Yanga, has also been discovered that it has brought the secretary general from Kenya, Patrick Nagi, the old elders of Yanga who previously refused because it is not a member of Yanga.

We are going back to the country that some of the members have a decision without knowing that because it is not supposed to say that, it is a chance to be employed and not the position of members to vote if they do with the chairman and other leaders.

The secretary is an important leader in any institution because it is a leader who is supposed to be responsible for a very long time in his institution and this is why he is involved in the long-term plans for our big club's members who are unable to identify their positions.

At the time of secretaries to be discriminated, they were sitting in power for a long time.

In these days the issues have been changed and after those positions they were announced by people who have been employed due to their professional reputation, there are several things to consider so as to build the secretaries who will be employed in these clubs to be employed in order to implement plans that they did for the purpose of development.

Seems to allow me for now the secretary of Simba and Yanga soccer club is as the registration of a player because the leadership can build a difficult environment because the private reason why you want to release his jobs.

As it is on some of the leaders listening to the office of their coaches in various aspects including registration, therefore, the way is for now, for the leaders to intervene in responsibilities of their secretaries to the current secretaries, in our old clubs have changed to be like the leadership of the club to do everything.

In this situation that is going on in the Yanga Club to change for secretaries, it is a must for members and leaders to look at afresh while being able to know that the problem is inside that club.

There is a result of tension about some people wanting what they said to be careful without being independent, but for the position of the secretary general, he is supposed to be given a chance to perform its work without enmity.

Perhaps, Yanga were able to pay hope by depending on this system of making sure I have to look for depending on a person, so they continuing to build himself themselves by making their plans they end in words of papers and they surprised many were very few.

Without change in this, things will be the same way inside Yanga club and it can say that Yanga did not get a secretary who will benefit them until now, that is why they have been doing everything after a short time?
