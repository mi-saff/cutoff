I was published today 27th September 2016.

The report that between January and August this year have occurred 6,971 points and lost life of 217 people and others were left out and they were left out and were left out and they believe that they don't be taken to the weight that are facing them.

We agree with the statement of the deputy minister of internal affairs of the country, Hamad Yussuf Masauni when he arrived at the time he was launching the travel week on road safety yesterday in Geita province that it is good for road safety to be the national agenda.
We have said that any right step that will help our nation to be able to come out of this matter that produces security and life of our people should be supported by one statement and every one that was a great one with our nation.
Masauni, in his speech he ordered the Tanzania Roads Agency (TANROADS) to remove the machines on the main road which he has been seen as part of the sources of road accidents.
The ability to remove the roads of the road, we have and if we see that it is very dangerous instead of the previous aim to reduce the speed of buses and other vehicles are on the road especially in dangerous areas and safety of citizens, then we should not hesitate to pave way for the danger to face.
Also, he made a statement given by the deputy minister and urged all road users to follow the law and road regulations as the keenly you are making, it has no need to be considered if each one of us.
Those regulations include them to stop making high speed, cross the air conditioning and motorcycle riders and a lot of children getting into the road under supervision.
But the report was also released at that event yesterday by the Deputy Minister in the Ministry of Works, Transport and Communication, who is also the deputy chairperson of the National Security Council, Edwin Ngonyani, said that the human crime has contributed to 80 percent of the accidents due to the aim of controlling it so as to save the lives of our people?
Why are waiting for these kinds of mistakes that are being used as required as being taken to the media to get the organizers of the relevant crime?
We are still saying that the problem to prevent us that 'unity is strength and separation is a problem, it is still needed to resolve the disaster so as to resolve issues of human beings and continue to lose their lives of our people and make corrections.
We are concerned, police on road safety and the government in general, we were forced to act, we will be able to increase the accident in accidents with the ability, we have people.
I would like to see a few people who're very happy without caring about the law and regulations that they continue to fulfill the manifesto.
