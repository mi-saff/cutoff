(()) one of the engineers who are implementing the projects of TANESCO advised TANESCO to create awareness to the citizens whom the project goes past about the importance of that project so that they can protect it .
<no-speech>
at the doors is one .
<no-speech>
when you arrive in those villages you gather many people .
we are asking you then to emphasize on the protection of infrastructure that we are putting up because we might be putting up then later because we pass in that place with -- with trees and there can emerge arsonists and later destroy the infrastructure .
because you are having many people we ask you then to expand your campaign and you insist on the protection of the projects we are taking .
and the second similarly is a request the you explain to them the cost price of the projects it's the government providing those money to take the electricity .
because it's very possible there in the village to be thinking that electricity is something very easy therefore you can just get it and (()) his .
the manager of TANESCO Nzega province advises the availability of a regulated price of electricity that results from the project of R_E_A in order to lower the cost of life of the citizens .
in the this project of R_E_A this phase one we have seen very many challenges .
<no-speech>
and similarly in %incomplete
according to the country procedures electric engineers get licenses from EWURA .
<no-speech>
and the goal (()) of the government to incorporate the price then was to lower the severity of life of the citizens in the village .
<no-speech>
but we see that after lowering the price the citizens are not benefiting because of that (()) they are charged very highly because the contractors themselves are using (()) to go to the villages to do the jobs .
(()) consultancy and marketing section if it could consult with EWURA at least in the villages' project to have a regulated price like that of petrol each person to put in his home but there is a regulated price so that at least we can we can get many customers and to lower for the citizens this year .
participants of strategy symposium of TANESCO in achieving the plans of the government to supply electricity in the villages were given a leadership challenge so that they can carry out their responsibilities with more accuracy .
<no-speech>
together that many people do not have project management skills but there is that knowledge that we have been given by God .
its not a must you be -- you be very learned .
<no-speech>
the first thing I request (()) my fellow I teach you that in leadership there are tools more than a hundred you as a leader .
now me I will give you three .
which each person to use starting today .
<no-speech>
tool number one when you are a leader in any place is a must you introduced yourself who are ?
that responsibility you are given introduce it first .
be confident in that your position .
that is number one .
<no-speech>
number two after you introduce yourself do not be timid .
<no-speech>
tool number two do not be timid .
<no-speech>
tool number three have a difficult decision .
my siblings without these things cannot move you must have difficult decisions .
am speaking this painfully because I have things -- examples is here it have happened to me myself in the year two thousand and twelve .
<no-speech>
I have been sort after in Kimbiji province from Yombo .
<no-speech>
then I found the contractor have build the project one with like six pillars .
is -- is just short not very big . the areas of Sarasara village .
<no-speech>
when I arrived the supervisor who came before me because I arrived he was taken elsewhere then I found him supervising that project .
<no-speech>
now I found (()) who (()) him .
contractor is complaining that he has not been paid because the supervisor has not written the certificate .
now there I saw (()) either this supervisor had no enough expertise on project matters and was dodging him .
now the first thing I did I explained to him please -- take me to see the project .
then I went and checked it -- and checked -- and checked -- and saw (()) it was there .
when I turned in the office I imagined (()) a man just quickly (()) .
<no-speech>
I think it took like a day (()) and it was found .
after finding it I explained to Yusuf (()) to give me like a week I will get in that book .
because I was (()) what I saw on site then I see I went on not (()) I went on (()) specifications (()) specifics I don't know what conditions after finishing to go through then I went to offer a formal advice the thing he did comparable to the contract is like I separated those two things but is like -- before I prepared the certificate then I explained to the contractor that there were many shortfalls I had seen .
<no-speech>
number one in the book of contract we need you to use the pillar of thirteen frameworks .
you have used the pillars of the frameworks (()) .
<no-speech>
you as the contractor who is paid are all of these not substandard I don't see -- I don't see this -- I don't see that .
he has used (()) that is (()) like (()) .
<no-speech>
now I certainly requested him make these corrections before I prepare the certificate .
now there I have told you that story so that you can know that I recognize myself .
I am a leader I have been given a responsibility .
<no-speech>
I must .
