In Zanzibar, there is a next budget to serve the citizens on the same time on 01 / 1st, 2012.

Every time the ordinary citizens are going to war because he is fighting the war with life every day in Unguja, you will face people who do not have employment in the estates or when they go to their offices, the owners of the Church to pray for ways to get their meal.
Going to the farm, it will use the condition and it's impossible so that our weakness is facing citizens.
In general, most of the people of Zanzibar that these days have remained as they don't know what they should do so that they can be able to get ways to use it.
Without doubt, if you are not the guest of Zanzibar but this close years has already paid fees.
The responsibility to reduce or glorifying the problem is the government and especially it is the minister for Finance and his ministry, the minister gets that opportunity when he presented the budget of the government's budget in the council of representatives.
In the next month, Minister of Finance of Zanzibar, Yusuf Omar Mzee, will presented the first budget of the national United Nations in special sessions of the council of representatives.
As people of Zanzibar, they are supposed to know that the budget will be very different from those two consecutive years which they contributed to make it the current state of the economy.
We have been made, a budget is presented to the council of representatives to hear the government it was presenting the Zanzibar's economy and grow and grow.
Apart from issues it is that the state of life of citizens or we can succeed or just like that, the explanation of the growth of the economy is a stern warning because there is a big challenge in the collection of free statistics, that is those who can be given by the government.
Minister of finance of the national government of United Nations is faced with a lot of challenges when he prepared the budget of this year's budget and other challenges are for a short time, another for the average of an average and another long time.
First, in a short period of time, he is responsible for solutions to the issue of lack of government funds and the remaining challenges, that is the ones for a period of average and long-term results, without doubt, it is implementing the plans that was prepared by the government in order to enable the Zanzibar economy to get solutions.
The people of Zanzibar explained that the future of them is good because the use of a long-term economy in the islands is good and they have faith that because there will increase investment from outside and they are happy about the expectations of establishment in free economic areas.
There are symptoms or we are participating with other things and give birth as well, for example, hope of being found in oil.
However, it is important that the economic diseases that bothers citizens are available on the budget of June this year, this is important to show that the policies of this government are blocking us and those of the past government, that these policies have a habit of serving the citizens.
Secondly, this is important for Zanzibar to be able to fulfill the future of their economic and development of their community.
If we have not heard more than any other in the United Nations, the national United Nations needs, again with an emergency, to have a easy food policy, so as to accompany the needs of every day to enable the citizens to get food.
Other things that need to be conducted and necessary for them is the standards of tax and tax, the cost of transport together with misuse of taxes once - and the Tanzania Revenue Authority and the Tanzania Revenue Authority.
As the people of Zanzibar, they have the desire to see how the finance minister will be playing in Karume on political issues about the leadership of the economy.
Also, that minister has no way to reach international funds that are offered by the institution as the ones of the World Bank and the Department of International Relations (IMF).
The current situation is ongoing and it will be important for a long-term plans to break-branding of the national government's economy. But the government will not be able to bring development to the economy system of free areas.
Certainly, that system of economy of free areas is needed in the islands to combat Unguja and Pemba islands and not in FGM and Micheweni Pemba areas because Zanzibar is the country with a small area.
Certainly, in the past we are in Zanzibar about the economy of the free area, a free area of the economy was in all the two regions and success which is available on that day it does not benefit from all those two countries.
It is very important to put him to make sure that in the colonial era of Zanzibar, it involves itself without depending on being sponsored by the colonial era.
Therefore, it was unable to give its social services, it was able to pay their employees' salaries for building hospitals and secondary schools so as to ensure that the government was able to form the infrastructure that was not explained at that time.
So that it can be able to take any action against the meaning in the economic and social sectors, and even political parties, the national government does not have a mistake but to change a quick discussion inside or outside the new constitution of the United Republic of Tanzania that will start being used for five years after failing.
The aim of those discussions should be to donate to those authorities and the economic and community development in Zanzibar which have contributed to a period of 47 years in the union.
By bad luck, the government of Tanzania did not used the authority to take all the project they will go to Zanzibar with I want economic development to its citizens.
The government of the United Republic up to now has been operated on since it was mentioned.
The Zanzibar authority has increased in a union to be demolished then Zanzibar will not be able to save its economy and the economy will continue to wane's economy.
For now the economy of Zanzibar has no doubt the following are very big number of people who do not have employment, the big number of people who do not have income to enable them use money, prices of food, oil and other products.
It has also been said that Tanzania mainland is not a great friend of Zanzibar as it is in China, for example the current situation is that Tanzania Mainland is involved or joined Zanzibar's economy on the internet and regulations that takes place in Zanzibar with the ability to control the economy.
Therefore, it can't make a lot a wall when he wants to fulfill it without favoring his community development.
And then there is an issue of corruption, this is a disaster which the United Nations has the ability to eliminate it and it does not happen if the excuse of getting into power from the United Republic has become a disease like cancer that has spread in Zanzibar countrywide and the Minister for Finance must use every way to fight the war.
Secondly, he would like you to have reliable data and show the level of corruption in that country and how it affects the economy of Zanzibar and the government is proud that the economy of Zanzibar's economy is growing by six percent (6 percent) every year.
Corruption is growing rapidly, it is growing by the length or more?
In the past Zanzibar did not have corruption if there is now a disaster has continued as a result of civil servants, the department that was one of the government's service with able to help several thousands of servants, bureaucracy that have been able to help them be used to cater for higher education services.
That, the first budget of the first government of the national United Nations in Zanzibar must know that there is a new year and not that in the past people, they will be mentioning the results of that budget and check how it will benefit those who do not have employment, those poor and poor eyesight.
