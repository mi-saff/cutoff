The leadership of Simba Club today is expected to officially announce his complaints to the Tanzania Football Federation (TFF) and the League Board (TLB) in order to sign the referee for their match against Yanga, Martin Saanya of Simba and Yanga at the National Stadium at the end of the week and scored a draw of 1-1 in that match that were filled with violence.

The violence led by the leading goal by Yanga that was scored by Amisi Tambwe, which was involved with him because before he was sacked, the player left the ball with an issue that caused violence to Simba fans since Ibrahim Ajib, followed by Simba the goal that broke up with the referee for claims that he was lost.
Those fans went up apart from uprooting the seats of that stadium and they can be allowed in the field.
"With great disappointment the Simba club has shown a lot of actions that were done by some of our fans of breaking part of the National Stadium, an act that happened yesterday (the day before yesterday) in our premier league game against Yanga team.
"We believe this actions that were done by our fans led by the decision that was caused by those referees especially Martin Saanya," said Manara.
"Does not exercised since the referee used the referee to put a ring on the goal of Yanga's striker, Amisi Tambwe and denied the legal goal of our striker Ibrahim Ajib, in that game of their fans entered into seats and said that they will communicate with the concerned authorities to pay them.
"We request for forgiveness for this matter and the club has agreed to pay for the cost of this destruction.
Even so, we have been surprised by the act of giving red cards to our captain Jonas Mkude, this situation as the captain asked him to go to him claiming that his action of accepting their goal was scored by him, then I have risen up and given a red card for him, then he has risen up and given a red card.
"We believe this journey to TFF and the league board will give a stern warning to these referees to be a lesson to those articles.
"Also, that club has complained that the action of our rooms looking for clothes the desire to ensure our players before the match started, we are requesting the authority to make sure that this situation that is needed is supposed to be done by our opponents.
"We know their intention is to make our players get married, but our scientists will take appropriate measures to ensure our players can be able to end ninety minutes of the game with the ability and professionalism," he said.
That is the second match to referee Martin Saanya about the goal of the type which last season in the FA match between Yanga and Coast Union that took place at Mkwakwani Stadium in Tanga and Yanga won 2-1, the game broke down after violence erupted.
In that game, Saanya was forced to break the game after Yanga's goalkeeper Deogratius Munishi 'Dada', being attacked by the Coast fans while the defender Oscar Joshua was scored by bottles at the head.
In that game, Tambwe went to take the position of Donald Ngoma taking birth to Yanga the second goal in the Simba soccer goal the day before yesterday and Coast to complain about that goal as a support.
