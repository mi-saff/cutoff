Possible.

Many are worried in my last column that I have said that Senator Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos will change and straighten out the mistakes of his parents during the time of martial law.
Some of our readers said that I have written the column because I did not experience the domination of Marcos dictatorship when Bongbong did not experience the sin of his family and asked forgiveness to the people.
I am saddened by this kind of comment because it is clear for me that this is a kind of part of the filipino people who have experienced seduction now, but I do not close my mind to know a leader with a potential to change our society.
This is an issue for the progress of the country and not in my personal feelings or experience that should not be used to the child's fault or mother, I think that they will be the one who will say that they will get rid of their parents because of the mistakes that they have done.
Another thing is, I believe that Bongbong could have learned from the mistake done by her parents, it is possible to change towards the goodness of a creature like Bongbong but I also cannot remove it that he might not have learned.
Still, as a Christian, I will be impatient for the belief that he has changed for the goodness that he has changed for the goodness of the parents because if that happens, no one can choose who has the right to handle the rights of power.
All of us are also victims of the mistakes of our parents or their own parents.
What do you think?
