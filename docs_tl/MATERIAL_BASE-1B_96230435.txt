We can do it: He is not a hero.
According to August 5, 2016, there are news that the burial of former President Ferdinand Marcos in the Libingan ng mga Bayani will be discussed in the Heroes' Cemetery next month and this is one of the promises of President Rody Duterte during the campaign.
Many groups will disagree and surely will oppose Duterte, even Vice President Leni Robredo is against this plan.

In my opinion, the proposal of former Senate President Aquilino "Nene" Pimentel, in the town of Batac, Ilocos Norte was said to be buried in the town of Batac, Ilocos Norte to bury the remains of Marcos there in Batac, that is why it is better that he will be buried there so that he will be buried there in order to stop a few years of debate on this issue.
For me, Marcos should not be buried in the Libingan ng mga Bayani as well as one of the leaders of the country who has the biggest stolen in the government where thousands of Filipinos were lost and killed by military and police.

Can it be considered as a leader who killed our freedom and agreed in the left murder of those who expressed their objection in the declaration of martial law, until now, the Marcos family is not yet visited by the Marcos family.
Until now the thousands of families lost their relatives during the time of martial law, even students in grade 3, know the meaning of being a hero, we can be considered a hero for the good of others and the people.

We can't be considered a hero for a leader who used his power to improve himself and his family.
If we will not oppose and allow Marcos to be buried in the Libingan ng mga Bayani, we showed the youth that there is a hero in his power and stole from the public funds.
Even if not even once, the Marcos family asked for an apology for the sins they did to our country, this is how kind of leadership what we want to make an example for the next generation of Filipinos?

Hopefully not.
