It is okay for two weeks.

Land Transportation and chuckled the Regulatory Board Chairman, Atty. Woodman, Ginez himself, due to severe traffic this past few days which paralyzed Metro Manila.
All the criticisms received by the LTFRB is everywhere, even those who have been with his agency have already been taken back against the LTFRB.
Nothing is tired of answering Chairman Ginez himself on the same time with blaming him, it's hard to try to listen to the critics, especially in the situation where the LTFRB is facing, which is a heavy traffic, and many are directly affected.
But let us also force to listen to the plan of the LTFRB and the answer of Chairman Ginez himself in criticizing her.
In fixing a traffic problem, not only one side should be heard.
In the case at the same time being applied for Permits, it needs to grant the request of all the stakeholders to give the trucks and permit that they are waiting for their permit from the LTFRB.
It can't be allowed to stop the journey of the trucks which bring all the businesses in the country to be affected if we insist on its immediate implementation, which is why Ginez was asking for time.
The deadline to be held is August 22, and after this, there is no extension.
The law will be strictly implemented - the colorum and out of line will be caught and be penalized.
Unity is what Chairman is asking for the extension until August 29 so the progress of business will not be stopped and not even the cause of the downfall of the economy of the country.
Ginez's position is not easy.
It is not a joke that more than two thousand number of trucks are not a joke that applied for permits to have legal trip.
A few years have passed when the trucks of trucks on our roads have been a problem, what are the additional two thousand pesos, what some of the entarming will speed up.
The answer of Chairman - "let us look for the right solution because it has been placed under the sake of the LTFRB for the interest of all.
