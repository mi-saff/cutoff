Theft from pork, goats, chicken and other pet animals of the masses around Ubao, Aguinaldo, Ifugao have no one who is pointing at his back, where they always get drunk, they are gambling, and they often shoot a gun.

Last April 2012, a 5-year-old man pretended to be a member of the NPA who choked P1,500 from a civilian before Ubbog, Dela Cruz, resident of Brgy Ubao, aside from this, they tried to get her pet pigs.

The students of Ubao, National High School is also often busy because of the continuous military troops of the 58th IB, of the AFP from their operation.

It seems that the carabao's troops were fighting with the troops of the 5th Special Action Force who destroyed the crops of the corn farm in Sitio Dalipey, Brgy. Hacadanan, instead of asking for apology and pay the damaged crops, an insult to the poor farmers from the troops of the AFP.

In other events, it was stopped and the military troops were investigated by the military who were riding a motorcycle at Sitio Giwanon, Barangay Poblacion, Barangay Poblacion, Barangay Poblacion, Barangay Poblacion, Barangay Poblacion, Barangay Poblacion, Barangay Poblacion, Barangay Poblacion, Barangay Poblacion, Barangay Poblacion, Barangay Poblacion, Barangay Poblacion, Barangay Poblacion, Barangay Poblacion, Barangay Poblacion, Barangay Poblacion, Barangay Poblacion, Brgy.
