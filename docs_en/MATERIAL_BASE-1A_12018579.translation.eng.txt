these stadiums managers are the sources of conflict
there is nothing as annoying as these stadiums managers giving an example those for the national stadium in the city of Dar es Salaam.
what I want to say is their habit of delaying to open the gates of the stadium.
they wait to open the gates at two in the afternoon, if that is not looking for chaos, then what is it!
I remember about some past Simba and Yanga matches, the gates were opened at ten in the morning and people got in as they wanted.
it was nice, opening the gates at one or two in the afternoon, here they want those riots so that they throw their bombs and ask for their bribes.
I think we should go back to the era of national stadium manager, Hassan Chabanga Dyamale opening the stadium at 4:00 in the morning and police are there from the start to the end.
these managers are a disregardful.
