There is one.
By George Pacu - true, January 4, 2017, every day I have a blood pressure, but I don't feel any pain aside from the blurring of my eyes.

I do not know what to do and I am afraid that it might be cancer.
It is scary to look at the dirt but usually, this is not dangerous, what it means is that Filipinos will have a problem.

Go to the doctor to know its cause, if blood is dark, it might come from ulcer or other problems in the Upper Filipino Workers or hemorrhoids.
The other reasons of blood on the dirt and government of cellular phones are the small ones who are usually mixed in the ground where they lose, the call here are people who are proud and might have a blood pressure.
It can also possibly happen if there is now a sign of tissue paper, just like what is happening when a person has a cherness and the cause of it is hard and big dirt.
If there is a measurement and wound in the stomach or the Small Town, there is also a blood pressure, which is usually came from the Social Weather infection or for a long time use of aspirin, Ibuprofen, buprofen.
Cancer - it was a point that came from Calps or clings of cells in Colon in Olongapo.
To be sure what is the cause of blood, go to a doctor so you will not get nervous and sleep well.
