Dodoma.
misunderstandings about the federation cup match that is organized by the Tanzanian football federation (TFF) came out in the middle of this week from some teams failing to arrive in the field for different reasons.
in Dodoma town, CDA was to play against Milambo of Tabora.
information of that match have been released at the time when leaders of that team were asking themselves without answers the exact day of that game because of unavailability of official information that showed the date together with the field that will be used for that match.
secretary general of CDA 'home children', Ringo Mussiba said they did have that match information until the other day Wednesday when was told by TFF that CDA will host Milambo and the game will be played in Jamhuri grounds Dodoma.
"the problem of this federation cup even last season has more challenges, information is not released as it should be like other leagues but also the organization of the match itself, clubs are suffering even the available share we are not given all."
Mussiba said that Milambo will be forced to pitch more than 10 camps in Dodoma town because apart from that match it will wait January first to play second division league games, his the second round game after the previous match in Tabora town after it ended in a tie of 1-1 at Ali Hassan Mwiny grounds.
at the same time CDA and Polisi Dodoma have been given eight balls by Dodoma province football association (Dorefa) in order to improve their preparations for the game particularly after those two teams did well away last week.
