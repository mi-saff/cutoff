Buses that have no productivity will not be able to live in Zanzibar.
Brightiles 11, 2015.

Next week I will continue with this last week about this election to be a lesson so as to say little about the challenges in the Zanzibar elections.
Let me start by saying that the election of the year 2015 has given a great lesson to the nation, we should know more like people and citizens, and that our decision has gone down and there's no reason why our leaders have a great contribution in every way or another we have been able to restore them here.
Our organization and its institutions also have a great contribution to them here, our political parties also have a great contribution of bringing to them here, here where we are not supposed to be proud of the level of people to be careful, not to prevent each other, not to be accountable from the citizens to the citizens.
We start responsible, as one person, we ask ourselves and let me know where each one of us has a problem and therefore, our religion or a human beings will not tell you how Tanzania is a big country in Africa and in the world?
And if you are a citizen to follow up and start with a finger to the others, I will ask you when the last time was participating in the sittings of your government's offices and then continue to identify the opportunities and changes in the country's campaigns and also start being satisfied by the government, it started being a good citizen now.
Zanzibar passes away, wisdom to be prosecuted?
The Zanzibar elections was held one day by the elections of the United Republic on 25 October. According to the constitution of the United Republic and the Constitution of Zanzibar, these two elections are different from any relationship.
I have been talking about authorities in this elections are being managed by two different authorities, looking for the constitution of the United Republic of Zanzibar under the Zanzibar Electoral Commission (ZEC), which is the reason for coordinating the presidential elections of Zanzibar, delegates of the council of representatives and councilors.
In the two different elections, the two commission are supposed to put its supervisors all over the country to manage election activities that will not be able to supervise and run the elections of the president of Zanzibar, representatives and councilors in all stations in Zanzibar.
At the time of election results going on under the Zanzibar Electoral Commission (ZEC), received several issues that in one way or the other being led to the chairman of the Zanzibar Electoral Commission to destroy the elections of the president, representatives and councilors.
The chairman of ZEC, brother Jecha has given more than eight reasons, I will explain a few days ago on the first time, when the exercise is going on by ZEC, as it is not enough to say the delegates of ZEC are going back behind when the delegates of ZEC are going back behind when the delegates of ZEC are going back behind when they face their party flag.
