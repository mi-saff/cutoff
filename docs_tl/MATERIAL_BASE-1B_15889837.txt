A soldier of the 31st Infantry Battalion of the Philippine Army was killed when he fought against a Tim of the New People's Army who stopped him and another companion for them to be attacked in Barangay San Antonio, Barcelona, Sorsogon at around 8: 00 this morning.

The two soldiers were included in the so-called Peace Agreement (PDU) that are stranded in the center of said barangay since October 22, and the NPA pulled a gun, which was why the NPA pulled out a gun, which was why the NPA confiscated his gun, which was why the NPA confiscated his gun.

Another soldier is coordinating with the civilians who were riding a tricycle with a tricycle and did not agree with the police operatives to avoid the possible damage to the civilians and negligence of the tricycle to burn the tricycle.

In line with this, the NPA was harassed by the PDT which is behind bars.

These steps by the NPA are the response of the complaints from abusive soldiers who are being complained by the soldiers who are being threatened by the soldiers and who are being threatened by the soldiers or supporters of the NPA because even them are being threatened by the military troops.

The revolutionary movement is being supported by the people to ask the PDT of Philippine Army to remove the PDT of Philippine Army even by the NPA rebels who continue to conduct action from the NPA until they were removed from said places.
