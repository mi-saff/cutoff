Can you remember the golden lesson?
In my age, the memories of the golden lesson is still clear on the rays of the sun when the Philippines is in Asia in the field of sports.
At this time, the same with Lydia de Vega, Elma Miputak, Paeng, and many others who gave honor to the country, became famous.
They just have a simple tactic on the golden lesson then on the sports wherein the country has a potential to find a potential and will discover the athletes who might be able to give in the national competition.
But it has been a long time since the athletes who got famous because of the golden crown has long been retired from the principle of gold and this is a result of the editions of the time of former President Ferdinand Marcos in the time of former President Ferdinand Marcos.
It's because the beauty of the golden retriever was not seen on who only saw who was the only one who saw or dragged the gold of the government, and given attention to the program in order to succeed.

But now, the Philippine sports is just depending on "ambi" which comes from the private sector that's why the government is just rude and the leading big companies that have personal interest and their interest in the terrorism.
It is not bad to help the private sector but the part of responsibility is in the government, as early as now, the funds of the government in sports may only be small, and it can't be taken away by a World Football League.
Even Quiti Kill is also not good that's why it's a long time before the potential of athletes are seen, the result is the continuous decrease of the Philippines in the field of sports.
