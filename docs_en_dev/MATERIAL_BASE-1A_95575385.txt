The fire is caused by customs tax on May 22, 2012.

The scandal of corruption in the customs tax unit of the Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA) at the port of Dar es Salaam that involved the evasion of billions of billions has come into a new chapter, some officers have been dismissed from positions and need to explain themselves within 14 days.

In an explanation of confirmation that the action have been taken, the chairman of TRA Board, Doctor Alberto Antonio VASHARI, has told Good Citizen earlier this week that the former commissioner of being taxed is being stolen from the position so that the investigation procedures against the accusations that involve him together with other concerned parties to be completed.

According to the long-term reports of this newspaper, corruption of government revenue in the port of Dar es Salaam has been causing a one company that is involved with selling of home equipment that began its activities in the year 2004, being run by some leaders and senior officials of TRA to pay for revenue.

In his past issues at the end of May and at the beginning of June, this year, this newspaper made news that concern revenue collection in the port of Dar es Salaam, where one private company has been able to help other traders to evade revenue worth billions.

But in his talks with Raia Mwema, there are great keenness that consider the scope of work laws, Doctor Chihira said that "we have begun to take action, although it is to complete our investigation by now, you cannot say one directly, it is a suspect," he said and added.

"Said the estimated TRA unit (TRA), did his work since April and presented its report to me about the loss of revenue from the country, there are those involved in two different areas of employment and even the managers, but there are also those involved with the management of TRA."

"Now according to the work procedures, me, who is the board chairman, I am talking to these board who use their employment contracts, have been given by the board and the management to deal with the management policies that were made up until now, it is urging the management to strengthen the customs commissioner, Batshuayi for his different work while the investigation is going on.

"However, Batuli explained that apart from the accusations that concern it as outlined in the remaining days if he wanted to say it's true that he has been involved until now, we cannot say it is true that he has been involved until we find his information with all his colleagues," said Doctor Chipa.

When he was asked, why the suspect was continuing to work even though in different responsibilities inside the previous employer and the danger of spreading rumors, he insisted that they are keen on work rules and part of those talks between Doctor Chidinma along with the author of this newspaper that was recently.

Mke Mwema should know why he is given other responsibilities, and the employer is the one who is accusing him and who is also wrong?

Doctor Chipata says that we must learn after the working laws when he wanted it is not my private sector or the board's law that is supposed to take stern action without being satisfied by listening to his explanations.

Mke Mwema should not use the loopholes to try to disrupt the evidence and especially considering that the network of the suspects is big within and out of TRA, and why you will stop the work instead if it happened to the land office in Kinondoni District?

Doctor Chipata says that we cannot stop the office but we need revenue that is why we should remove it when he was the beginning, but that is one place of action that can be taken later.

In another step, when he was asked about the step against the business people that were involved in removing legal tax through the company's home equipment, Doctor.
Chiwanga said that investigation will be conducted earlier and that those involved will be able to pay for the whole amount of taxes that they've ever since the beginning of the game until now.
