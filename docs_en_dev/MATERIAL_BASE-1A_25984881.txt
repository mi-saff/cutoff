The problem of electricity is.
And apologized.
The step by the government to launch a project that will increase 140 megawatts of electricity in the country is to be added, although it is not required to assure citizens that more better and distribution of electricity production.
The project of electricity distribution in the country sponsored by the Kenya Power company is one of the most important things associated with the citizens and investors.
At a long time we have witnessed a lot of living from investors about the cost of electricity energy, a situation that is taking them to increase the cost of products or else they can get a loss in their businesses.
Likewise, the citizens who use electricity in their homes have been witnessing its electricity costs immediately and this situation does many like to live with questions about the truth we are able to live in competition and nations that continue, because Kenya didn't witness this in the 21 century.
That sector is among the most important institutions in the efforts to evade the progress of development in the country and to improve the life of life to the citizens.
Therefore, it is needed a lot of steps although it is not enough to make sure that it should be taken to improve the provision of that service.
An increase in the level of electricity energy which is not enough is not enough, because those of the old ones that will be used to distribute electricity.
It is a must that Kenya Power company will invest in modern technology equipment if we want to see change in service provision.
It is a shame to be in this era, the residents of various streets in Nairobi, the main city of Kenya is bigger than 24 hours because there was a shame when there was a shame when it is in the farm especially in areas where the rains are part of the daily lives.
It will be wise, if there will be safe equipment that can be allowed to make a bad state in the air, especially the rains.
It should be remembered that the government has been on the race for several years now to increase the number of people that get access to electricity in the farms, although there is a system of switching off their disappearance.
There will be no benefit if the government will give the production of more weight and forget about improving the systems of distribution of that service.
Those two issues are a terrorist and therefore you should be dealt with together.
There has been the analysts of the economic issues that are determined, the presence of another electricity distribution company which will give competition in Kenya Power.
In any business, competition lead in the concerned company to try more effort in providing services to customers.
A good example has been allowed to be open in the mobile phone sector where the existence of many companies in the provision of these services has contributed to enable customers to cater for the companies that do not benefit more.
In Italy, we will inform all the primary schools to finish more on the best distribution services of electricity, or else they can be able to increase the amount of electricity which is available, it will be benefits to the citizens.
