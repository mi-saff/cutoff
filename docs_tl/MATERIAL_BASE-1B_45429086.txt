Things have a lesson.

If you are in a life, do not follow the flow, instead, follow the bet.

Every thing in life is a lesson that you are scheduled to show to you to wake up the challenge and challenges coming in your life when you do not know your experiences in life to get to know your real personality.

The things that are happening to you are like when it comes to the stairs that you need to climb to reach the success that you're going to pass, that is why they do not know that they need to leave from where they are in.

Be calm and patient when you feel that things are not right and beneficial, and you really have no hope to rise from life.

Accept that this is not the right time, and there is a need for many training and burning eyebrows to be certain about the fulfilment of your dreams.

You have the fares in every thing that is happening to you, you can treat it as a opportunity and to lose hope, or will be treated as a challenge to your ability to succeed.

Maintain the fares that cannot be fooled by a body with no head.
