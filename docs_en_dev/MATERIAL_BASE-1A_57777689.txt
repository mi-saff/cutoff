My husband has not seen.
I don't know what I have been married and we have two children. During this time I am pregnant for another woman and I decided to get her child born by another woman and I decided to leave it.
I request your advice.
Through the same way, if that situation is very difficult to decide whether you and her husband have already have two children and is expecting a third child, when I explained it, and that is not his behavior, try to speak with him about his act.
Asking for forgiveness and would like to assure you that they will not slap him so as to maintain your marriage.
It is difficult to look for all ways to resolve the problems before thinking of breaking marriage.
