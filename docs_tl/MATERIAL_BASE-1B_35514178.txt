The 31st Infantry Battalion are attempted to be charged with 31st Lieutenant.

It would be recalled that the Pregoner were able to fight and got caught in the custody of the Bagong Hagdan in the attempt to defend them by the military troop in Barangay Puting as, Sorsogon City last night at November 7, 2012.

In order to rise up the failure of the said Strike operation, the 31st IB, that there are those who were wounded on the germs of the BHB) the truth, the civilian was hit by the incessant firing of corrupt soldiers.

There is always a civilian where the soldiers turned to and when they failed in their operation, a few barangays in nearby areas where the soldiers forcibly entered the house of Mrs. Rosemarie Interned in Barangay Sibol, Gubat, Sorsogon and threatened to kill his family.

We will challenge the Commander of 31st IB, Lt. Col. Teolo Toribio, he recommends his personnel to fight and not the civilians who have no enemy, you are brave to fight the civilians, you are coward with real fight.
