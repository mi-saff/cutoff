In many areas of the country, there have been a long period of some citizens to lack land for agriculture, livestock, and construction of houses while in the areas around them, there are few citizens who have stolen a lot of areas where many of them have gone into a story due to not being continued.

That cry now has been heard since the fifth term government, has started to take action as to arrest those people due to them not improving, instead, giving them with great intention of developing including being given farmers for agricultural activities.
As it is not enough, the day before yesterday the minister of land, housing and human settlements development, William Lukuvi noted the government's strategy to control more easily in areas without improving and starting from July next year, to be put up a stern legal action against the owners of those land, they will be charged high taxes.
We are increasing the decision by the government because the situation has been bad, the rich people that own a great land without developing the while they are surrounded by the citizens in those areas they don't have areas to grow and build houses.
They are using that opportunity and educate Tanzania that the "people have people," since those areas they are using the leasing project to the farmers for agriculture only without making them be land owners.
Others have risen up more, the land that own land is growing and use for the purpose of getting loans for the bank, loans which did not go for agriculture, livestock or even building industries and the country to get income and people to get income and people to get income and people to get employment.
We have also said that there are some who use more than five plots, they were involved in many years without caring about the presence of the law, which will use the advancement of more than five years later they sell themselves at a high price while the government collected and selling them in order to get a housing problem.
As a result of that situation in the new areas like Geology, Kiselya Village, Masaki, Bunju, Bunju, Dar es Salaam up to today, since the fields will be implemented in 2003), that will be continued and change in a story of criminals.
There are other areas like Geology and Mabwepande claimed that the fields should not be given three years, there are no symptoms of starting the construction.
While people are spoiling the areas and cut off at large numbers, there are many lack of funds to build residential houses have no land for building, therefore the aim of the government to reduce the residential problem continues to hit rock bottom.
According to the government through the Minister of Lands, Lukuvi has promised to address this issue of brotherhood to land without developing and making sure that the law is ending in areas without considering the position of the owner in the community.
We are saying that, because there is a rumor that there are two governments lawyers and even business people have great areas and they have not continued with the poor citizens, when they get problems in the construction of residential areas, agriculture and livestock.
The act of people looking at the land when others do not have even a little part of putting up food, it is causing them to hatred.
The situation that was left is same as a bomb that led to many, the ones that did not meet the ones that are there.
It is good to take precautions early before the danger of the law that is in order for people to promote land for the construction within three years to work on actions, the government will start being used to work in every area.
