Employee is supposed to avoid dangerous environment.
We have seen many times some of the employees to implement their responsibilities, in a dangerous environment, therefore, the employee continues to implement its responsibilities in an environment that forced the procedures with others not knowing that their environment are affecting their health.
Together with that, many workers are supposed to hear a certain person, who was doing work in the factory or that company died there is no even one of the workers that take action of analysts about the source of that death.
The employee told your employer or a task is to know about some of the chemicals that are in the industry, which usually increased by causing various effects for cancer.
Most of the workers are believed to have died before their age, by thinking that it's not a sin and by thinking that value of them is low because of poverty or because of lack of education.
Some of the employers who think that they have the right to reduce the value of its employees, so that they can get financial services.
Several employees in the country have lost their organs or their lives, the shivered because of preventing dust from the mud being part of the work.
These effects are not only for employees, but even the residents going to the mines.
There are a big number of employees who today are doing work in difficult environments where many people are determined by their employers in the environment that have been surrounded by poison without caring for the reasons they want to get great benefits.
Today you pass through some of the industries and even some of the business people here in the country, you will discover people be dealt with yourself and believe that they are living in good environments than other human being that is known as people living in difficult environments and believe that they are living a difficult life and their families without work.
Some of the industries once you put in employees in the environment of protecting themselves from danger, as if when it is a leader he visited the factory, leaving the workers not to stop and continue with the work as it is that, they still don't know and don't know her rights.
Remember, the workers remember that those environments are inspiring.
But when you find out of someone who had work at work we died, and do not think about the death of his fellow employee who was caused by what.
The workers are required to know that the chemicals, dust and many other things have reduced by giving someone that is going slowly.
It is very important for employees to know this issue that in this world, where people continue being implemented by giving up and knowing more, some employers see the safety of their workers at a very high level, because of doing so, they do not use extra costs so as to reduce the benefits.
It is about the employee asking him about his safety in work, if there are signs of small security, it's good for the employee who wanted to look at the way to get employment or to change the activities, but if there are difficulty of getting employment or to change the activities, but if they take their lives.
