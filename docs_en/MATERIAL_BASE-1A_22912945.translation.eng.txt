head of the Kinondoni district, Ally Hapi, has formed a committee of six people to go through the law concerned with entertainment issues as well as collecting views from shareholders, vendors, bars and hotels and doing research on how music sound is scheduled.
that committee will carry that research so that this business can be archived without violating the laws of the country and without being tortured or tortured by anyone else.
Hapi formed the committee at his discussion session with homeowners, bar and hotels that took place in that region.
he said that that committee will have to have a writing that will advise on ways of archiving that business, including authenticity of the laws of running the entertainment sessions.
he added that, homeowners, hotel and bar are supposed to make sure that they run their sessions on legal foundations, and the principle to avoid the noise of a musical nature in those regions.
Kinondoni Municipality Director, Aron Kagurumjui, wanted those owners to make sure the focus is on the directions they were given to reduce unnecessary relationships in running the entertainment session.
