There are many challenges that cancer patients are meeting especially for women who have breast cancer.
Those challenges have caused those patients to give up the opportunity of continuing with treatment and decided to give them a loss and return to their homes.
That situation happens after getting tired of stopping the money to withstand the cost of drugs while distributing them and away away from the Ocean Road Hospital (ORCI) that is dealing with the treatment and investigation of the disease.
The biggest challenge where many victims want to be assisted include the availability of herbal medicines or the ones that are given as a treatment in that hospital.
Speaking recently during the launch of the Hope Program of a woman, one of the patients, Bieldt, says that they are told the drugs are free but when they get to ask for many times you are told, therefore he will be forced to buy in the foreign shops where it is very expensive.
"I have paid the gap in the first round with a lot of problem at a cost of shillings 200,000 after being told that those drugs are not found in the hospital, here when I was told I don't know the second phase and three I will get them," said Shaw.
He explains that he was born in Tanga province to follow the service in Dar es Salaam city after his brother who helped him to be able to withstand the distance of a distance since it was difficult to pay for them at there.
Another patient Mwajua Mohamed, says that the society is still dug well related to that disease and many women do not love the hospital and believe that they can be operated on and died.
He claims that the current community in some of the areas and especially in the villages did not believe if the breast cancer patient can be researched on.
He explains that even when he was surprised by that disease in 2013, he had stop stuttering on his brothers and believe they will agree that it will be an operation to remove the disease.
"I feared being informed because there are others who are known, they have already been operated on and they believe that even the treatment of radiation has effects.
", but after a time to go to you, there was a decision to go to the hospital and we put the decision to go to hospital and they also advised the brothers who have refused to get married, therefore I met my brothers and they agreed to help him," he says.
Mwajua, says there are faith of witchcraft in that disease and also there are people who believe that sexually transmitted diseases, therefore you are building a cancer victims when they can be infected.
And the Director of Directors of Standards (TCB), Halima Kasibu, says that many patients have come back to their villages after failing to withstand the cost of buying those drugs for all types of diseases together with other problems that they get at the same time.
"China' medicine is very expensive so as to prevent low-income income and they are unable to sustain themselves among the patients who came to follow up the services they want to go through," says Kasanga.
