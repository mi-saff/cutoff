he said, the buyers from different areas of the neighboring countries are checking more on the quality of the environment that is being operated in these businesses and the fish products needs hygiene because of the environment and the kind of business itself.
"you know fish and seafood needs great care and a clean environment, when people are face to face with an environment that is not clean, they are disgusted and discouraged to buy your products" said Doctor Kamani.
on his side, the head of the district of Momba, Abihudi Saideya, said that the residents of Momba district get fish through Lake Rukwa which is on the side of the valley of that district.
he said, however, that for a period of six months the lake was closed because of the damage to the environment which was done by the citizens and thus caused the lake to dry up and the production of fish was poor.
"we closed Lake Rukwa with the cooperation of the district who are the main users of this lake, we opened it after 6 months but still the production is low" said Saideya.
and the officer of fisheries for Momba district, Ali Libenanga, said that for the six month period after the opening of that lake, a total of 108 million has been collected from the taxes of fisheries and even though the fish that are being produced in that lake are stagnate and not growing at right level.
Doctor Kamani did his tour by visiting the business people of Dagaa who are on the border of Tunduma to check the environment of those businesses that are in the borders areas whereby he also met with Executive Councils of the city of Tunduma.
