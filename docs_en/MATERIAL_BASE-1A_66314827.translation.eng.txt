after Chadema announced holding protests Ukuta countrywide on Monday, 1 September, President Magufuli has spoken about those who want to hold protests in the country, President Magufuli has warned them to stop daring him for they will not believe what will befall them.
he made the statement in this town at his first public rally in Singida Region since he was elected as the president of the United Republic of Tanzania last year.
those who are promoting protests should lead, they shouldn't precede children of the poor by giving them parcels while they remain in the hotels listening to them.
the people have chosen us to bring progress and not protests. therefore, I do not want anyone to delay me he said and added,
"they shouldn't dare me by forcing protests on the first of September, anyone who dares whatever will befall him mmmh, he will never forget.
"I'm so different so they shouldn't dare me," warned President Magufuli as he was cheered by the great crowd in attendance.
President Magufuli said it is allowed for politicians to hold meetings to encourage development in their areas," if you are a member of parliament of Hai constituency, go around your constituency until you tired and not leaving your area and heading to Shinyanga to persuade people to protest."
I have not restricted the activities of the elected in their areas, rather I have refused for a person to leave his region and cause chaos in another area.
in addition, he urged the people to continue to support and pray for him especially during this season as he continues to deal with corruption in the country because those he is serving are ordinary citizens in the country whose living conditions are poor.
tomorrow, President Magufuli is expected to complete his two-day visit to Singida Region by addressing a public meeting in Misigiri area in Iramba District.
