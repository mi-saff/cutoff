Philippines Hong Kong - a tribute to our beloved country is the land that we came from and will continue to receive blessing and blessings, and in deed of love, we will never disappear, the importance of love, is given to us.

Pay attention to this, kidnappers and fill one hand of sand, if you forced to stop the hole of your fist, it will be more than the fingers of the fingers, and the fingers are starting to stop and stop the fall of sand.

This is also what we have experienced in life; if you are greedy and strict in a fair salary, you will lose more and always depend on others, you will not be silent and peaceful.

Like the gifts, this is not hiding and put it in time.

They use these for giving importance to others and continue to give back to others even if no one can stop it again and with the number of people who are given to us again, will return to more than those who are given to us.

Whatever thing that was given to us is that it is not our property.

She borrows it just like our borrowed lives but will only be short and has a scheduled end.

A big mistake is not used for your talent and hidden traits that was given to you to use your character in making goodness for all.

Let us take advantage of the opportunity to focus the appreciation of this gift that was given to us, to care, and improve it to serve the others our country is a gift to us, and no one else like this.

There will be no more happy than to love our own us, from 7,107 which have been laughing at all kinds of nature, we are starting to celebrate and we are convicted by all people, and any part of the world.

Let us accept that we are truly lucky in having a country in the Philippines, our land that we will be home for and will be sent back together with no pity and being grumpy.

You, thank you, all of us are totally receiving the gift that we provided to us.

As real Filipinos.
