this is the last week for the preparations of the Christmas holiday and the New Year, therefore, every family is preparing to have in place strategies to ensure these holidays are done with love and peace.
it's good for women to participate in the holiday plans by ensuring the children are happy by the ability they have without looking at certain families' plans in celebrating those holidays, since it's good to look if you have the ability to travel, it's good to do that way and if you have no ability it's good to do the celebration at your home.
in these holiday times, there has been a tendency by some women to require a great deal of needs beyond their ability and without looking at other responsibilities that are in front of you, that isn't right at all.
since as women you are required to look at priorities and even in the buying of new clothes, you can do that for the children alone but you can also cultivate in them a culture of being bought clothes any time whenever there is money and not a must on holiday seasons, since that issue can result in conflicts among the children in the family just for missing out on the clothes.
with love if you live like a family, it's good to look at the ability that's present and to put united plans by giving preference to love in those preparations, holidays will be done in love and to a high standard even if there various economic challenges.
for certain women are the pillars of the family hence it's good to be the managers of these preparations if it's together with helping each other in the family in various issues with the little you have and not waiting for everything to be done by your husband.
that's when you'll see the importance of having something to do and stop being just idle waiting to be fended for, certainly when you'll give your contribution to the celebrations and even to other responsibilities of the children for the next month, your worth to your husband increases in seeing that he truly has a helper in the house.
therefore, in actualizing everything, there must be love that will bring happiness and peace in your house during the whole preparations period even in future holidays.
