Decided.

The truth is, we do not need a lot of money to be happy and we usually do not have money, but if we want to be happy, there is a way, especially this Christmas.
This is the principle being implemented by the local government unit of QC.
Do you see the beautiful lights in the city hall and in Quezon Avenue, the heart will rise and makes a big amount of money here, the news that the residents who have the ability will not lose the Christmas present of the mayor.
Yes, and there is no party, but it does not mean that the residents of our fellow countrymen also understand the situation of our countrymen in places which are devastated by typhoon Yolanda and the earthquake, how are they going to join now?
But, the local government of QC is one of those who were reported to have sympathized with those affected.
Mayor Bistek and VM Belmonte provided the help of 50 million to the victims when the owner could reach and make the money that the people from Quezon City reach and make a way.
This is not the first help of QC to Filipinos who are victims of calamities then, even if there is a need, first in line, the QC police who are ready to save for help are not in need.
The happy community community is important to the QC, and this is what pushed Mayor Bistek and Vice Mayor Joy to force the "epal" of Christmas holiday in the whole city, that's why we want it to be.
We will be helpful to those who are lonely if we do not only sympathize with them but also in our enjoyment they are with, good things, a small amount of contribution to the poor countrymen, it is fine.
What is important is that the government is hardworking that we make it happy.
