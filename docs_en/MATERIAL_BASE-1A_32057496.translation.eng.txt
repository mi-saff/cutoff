the NMB golf competitions, Monthly Mug, have been held during the weekend on Lugalo golf courses, where a total of 60 players competed.
those tournaments that are being sponsored by NMB bank, are held every end of the month in that field, involving star players of NMB and Jeshi Lugalo teams.
speaking during the tournament, captain of the NMB Golf Club, George Kivaria, said the tournament has been the same every month, with superiority and competitiveness enhanced.
Kivaria said that the tournament involves senior and junior teams, whereby in the morning it's the seniors' turn and during the day until evening it is the juniors' turn.
he called on the players of the game to come out in numbers to participate in the NMB Monthly Mug since they have become a free platform of golf stars to improve their game levels.
he challenged Tanzanians who fear that game, thinking it is for the rich, by telling them NMB has erased that status and turned it to be a game that can be played by all communities.
"NMB sponsorship in this competition has changed the image of golf.
it is now being played by low-level people, who were previously scared of this game," said Kivaria.
Michael Misabo, who is a player of the NMB squad showed clearly that the competition in that tournament is big while asking various golf stars to join them.
"here are two teams of Jeshi Lugano and NMB.
this is of army Lugalo involves military offices and soldiers, but this of NMB involves civilian players.
"so civilian players should volunteer to join us in these end month tournaments, which through NMB sponsorship has made it competitive," he said.
