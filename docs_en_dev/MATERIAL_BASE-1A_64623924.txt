Interests, local positions which provoke each other in the military were there on May 31, 2012.

In part of the first part of this article last week, we saw the minister of foreign affairs and defense of the time, Oscar Assenga, how he could convince the soldiers who came out on January 21, there were only back to the camp, to address their complaints.
We saw how the father of the nation, Mwalimu Julius K. Nyerere, was able to escape the state of destroying the rebels who went to look for him, he didn't jump and it is very delicious.
The teacher entered suddenly in the two days later, he is holding back to power again, even so, four days later, the police moved again and why should follow the second part and the last part of getting the answer.
The second day after going back to the camp, the rebels were seen happy shortly to see the English officers leaving if they had promised and Kambona, but one of them did not have joy as others thank Sergeant Samuel Hoja.
During the funeral of two soldiers on that day, those who were killed in the streets and Mwarabu has said at the time of rebellion, Sergeant Samuel Eto'o followed him at the pitch and therefore, he was not able to implement all that he promised?
That day was received a report that the second squad of the army that was in Tabora and it was very delicious.
It is possible that they have not received information that of Colombo, they have returned to the camp or they did not know, but they wanted them to look for several things in their squad.
While in Tabora region it is going on with a rebellion, when it was received a good phone from Kambona, that he was appointed the captain Zlin Repyson (left) to be the head of the squad.
Aldine Soulaimane while he was sent to the mourners, and asked the phone to be responsible for a voice and then gave him a command, "Masau boasted." He made plans to serve the English officers to Dar es Salaam and finally their homes.
The event of January 21, and that of Tabora, together with the situation that was in Kenya, Uganda and Zanzibar, made the British Government to take a stern warning by taking the 2000 soldiers to East Africa.
Therefore, their friendship called RÃ©my at the coastal region of Dar es Salaam, and another he was forced to buy a plane, he arrived with 600 soldiers.
The third day after a rebellion and first squad on Wednesday, January 23, in the morning, suddenly Nyerere received an open vehicle with Mama Nyerere and the minister of internal affairs, Job Ndugai, visited each part of the city that was affected by a rebellion.
On Thursday, January 24, it was safe for Friday, January 25, talks between the government and the rebels were seen not to start the broke up, they went up again.
Different from the rebellion of January 21, which did not involve politicians, nor the objective of politics, this new rebellion could be stopped by flute of politics.
Security reports were seen that, leaders of the council leaders were when they meet with the police who arrived at Colombo, and that those parties were organized a strike at the end of the week to join those officers.
Such a series of rebellion like Kenya and Uganda continues to resolve the same way, that day, at the same time, and in that system.
Jomo Kenyatta, and Mkukuta, tried to leave at times when they are preparing the England army to prevent a rebellion like Nyerere did not want it to believe that his fellow army would not want him to see him and his government.
He started believing that police officers told the list of great ministers, that was organized by the rebels and one of his close people went up to tell him that, he had been requested not to be the vice president after the revolutionary party, that his government was in danger.
That is when getting 11 o'clock in the day, the teacher entered the State House, the Deputy Ambassador of England, Mister F. Stephen Millinga, gave the military support of the army and without being late, Millinga, when he took the information to London and went to be stopped.
And Oscar Tarimo, he went to the England ambassador to look for the killing that she had flooded the country for a whole week, requested them to support him at night, in the whole week, to urge them to support them on Wednesday night, and another officer, they were giving them up to their submarine in the Coastal Region.
On Saturday, January 26, 2016 at 6 o'clock in the morning, I was beaten six soldiers from their submarine in the past 10 o'clock in the morning, around 12, 30th June, their submarine in the past 10 o'clock in the Coastal Region and participated in the attacks by signing the rebels.
From a distance of 20 hundred thousand shillings, and with great courage, Douglas company was announcing the microphone and saw his authority again, he gave out the orders from all the police to remain in the camp and "the weapons" and not on the road.
After 10 minutes without seeing the something, he started counting, "one, a few days ago," the English police had a bomb attacks until the rebels started shouting.
In the other 10 minutes followed, 150 soldiers were surrendered and 150 others after one hour to reach 1 o'clock in the morning, all of five injured were injured in the whole week of rebellion, less than 17 people were injured.
While the police force of the England army involving the Russian militants, in Uganda and Kenya where the army was taking a step such a time, at the same time, at 4 o'clock in the past, and in the 11 squad of Barqat Mvungi (Kenya).
.
Those phones were easily read, "police force have been abducted by unknown people.
Help him quickly to bring in the police force of the United Nations, Lieutenant Colonel Sakali.
I reemergence in our primary question, who enables a rebellion like our army in the year 1990, Oscar Assenga and John Okello?
Likewise, he was a minister who is responsible for security during the time, where the police was under his ministry because of this reason, they should be taken to him in accordance to the first phase, he would not be taken and that he knows that plan.
It's only his courage and not to deal with that situation so that if it is true that he had a bad intention to the government and by considering how he is controlling the situation and the police decided to overturn the country which was a result of the army for two consecutive days?
So, it's a day before yesterday, "John Okello's' it does not have a long time because for the whole period since the overthrowing of Zanzibar, he had a certificate of protecting and strengthening its administration in the islands due to the threat of his skill.
Okello's led the Revolutionary Government of Zanzibar for two consecutive months before his resignation.
Or not you are not supposed to know, a rebellion like Kenya and Uganda especially considering that the army of these three countries have been born by the police force of the English Premier League, and in the same period, their complaints were seen as the same time.
I agree with the opinion of Ambassador Abbas Khajida Kopa, (he was quoted saying in the year 2001), "a rebellion like Tanganyika army and to promote African countries," it was the case for a rebellion like Kenya and Uganda.
Or I don't understand that, leaders of Political Parties will join the rebels in the second phase to bring down the government, due to the fact that, since the teacher entered the "African Legislative Assembly," January 2001, they had been made a lot of time since it is understood. "
As a result of the rebellion, Mwalimu where he removed the whole squad (Colombo and Barqat Mvungi who were chosen to bid farewell to 100 police officers of the second squad, Tabora, he taught the 10 percent of the police who were involved in order to implement their responsibilities.
More than 400 people were arrested and questioned, including the leaders of the workers of the workers and 500 others were given out on the law to prevent danger, but many were left out by the Federation of Political Parties, the ruling Party - Tanaka.
In the beginning of April last year, the army of England entered with his position being taken by the third squad of Nigeria, under Lieutenant Colonel James Pickup, when she was found guilty of the police force and scored 15 years, its 13 partners have been sentenced to five years to ten years.
The Swahili people said, "each other has no weeds," Mwalimu added the least being of a salary of soldiers, from 105 / = to 240 / = shillings for a month.
But the important thing more than all of us are that for a rebellion they were able to help him and know the type of army that is needed for the country like our country.
