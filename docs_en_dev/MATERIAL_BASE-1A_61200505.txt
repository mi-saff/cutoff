This newspaper in the end of yesterday was a news with a news reporter, that is an issue that "eating foods that are not affected by many."

According to the news, currently, many residents of big cities in the country like Dar es Salaam, Arusha, Tanga, Mwanza and Mbeya, are faced with non-communicable diseases easily because of the use of food and drinks that consider the quality of food and drinks.
Also, the news explained that lack of foods that are not associated with food, causes different diseases like diabetes, the problem of eating and drinking alcohol that doesn't affect the criteria is big in big cities due to the availability of food and drinks, and also lack of time and areas to do exercises.
We are supporting the statement of health professionals, including specialist doctors of non-communicable diseases, that there is a big number of people with those diseases but not knowing if they are sick.
One of the specialist doctors, Doctor Rose Mdami has said that the investigation that was done by the organization that deals with non-communicable diseases in the country has shown that in Arusha Province the 30 percent of these people are faced with diabetes, which are as a result of food, also as a result of doing exercises.
In addition, we support the statement released recently by the adviser of the health sector in the country, Doctor Ali Kiba that several issues of life affect the health and avoid various diseases that are not a must include smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol.
According to Doctor Mzige, integrity and cigarette are in a big possibility of getting more than 40 diseases, which is dangerous to their health, such as cancer, heart diseases, heart and 60 diseases such as malaria diseases and reduce 4 machines for AIDS patients.
We thank the health insurance activities to continue to continue in all provinces in the country, because many people are patients, but do not know and they are not seen the hospital many times, a situation that causes many times to lose lives.
It is clear that many people, especially the low-income income, they don't have time to test their health as well as focusing more on the difficulty of life, most of them get married or not using drugs at the drug shops without caring.
When they are saying that we may be in the hospital and they were found with great problems, therefore it's difficult to enable the citizens to test their health as required by seeing the citizens to test their health as required by the end of the month and a day of planting trees nationally.
We say he insisted that a big way to deal with various diseases are we must change and do exercises for your body every day.
