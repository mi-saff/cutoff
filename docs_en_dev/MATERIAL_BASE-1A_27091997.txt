The first round of the Tanzania Mainland Premier League for the year 2016 / 17 has been completed on Thursday after Yanga finished his second against Ruvu Shooting team in the Coastal Region.

That game that took place at the Uhuru Stadium in Dar es Salaam, previously was on Wednesday together with other matches including Simba and Prisons, but it was pushed forward after JKT asked.
The national building for the national building for the Tanzania Football Federation (TFF) through the league board wants citizens to remain in one day after he is tired of the long journey from Bukoba, Kagera where he had a match at the end of last week.
In addition to the results of that game against Yanga who were scored 2-1, the greatest one is the end of the first round of that league that involves a total of 16 teams. The league was completed, we got the representatives of Tanzania mainland at the African Champions League competition and that of the African Confederation Cup.
The first story has narrated that most of the things had a lot of challenges, the ones that are supposed to be played or else they will continue being an actor in the national soccer club and even our national team.
All the days when you are in the national premier league, without doubt, you will get the national team so that his players benefit from that club which are participating in that bad and competitive league.
On the side of the club, it is the same way for a team that will get the championship without a mental health or their efforts, therefore he will be found a specialist who has no ability, who are participating in the international competition will be released early.
The first round of the Tanzania Mainland Premier League, we have witnessed great tension between the referees, who some of them have been unable to consider the 17 soccer laws by preventing themselves.
It is possible that other referees are proud of it by bad luck and others did not make sure after being pumped by the blood from some side or the others did not want to do so, but because of the end of those laws, that is why they found themselves in trouble.
To know that the law is one of the issue and implemented another issue, therefore it can be a threat to our referees and they have been unable to do well. On the TFF's side themselves should be very keen because we have seen cases of breach of peace as at the National Stadium, where Simba fans abused their seats.
Referees being unable to follow the procedures or soccer laws not only to cause lovers who do not have faith, apart from improving infrastructure, also they can be able to make those referees to ensure that the referees have been planned to make soccer in their rights without favoring any time.
