I'm afraid he will use then dump me.
I have a lover whom I've known for several weeks now.
we made love the second week after knowing each other claiming that is the only way to show we love each other.
now he wants us to continue but I am afraid he will use and then dump me.
I don't want and I'm still a student.
advise me.
via SMS, his allegations that making love is the only way to show that people love each other is a total lie.
don't agree again since you're still a student and he can impregnate you and then dump you.
he has another one: there is a guy who we are in love but I hear people saying that he has another girl.
advise me.
hearsay can be true or untrue.
investigate those reports until you confirm.
if you realize it's true, leave him since that shows that he isn't faithful to you.
