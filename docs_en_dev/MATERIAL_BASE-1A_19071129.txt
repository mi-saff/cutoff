This fight for the government and doctors Ikome, Jide 16, 2012

Our country could have a lot of sadness and tension between the doctors and the government without fear and fear.

It is unacceptable, because this is our country, they are happy to know that our doctors and the ones that are trusted by our government are the citizens of this country who will be taught and even lost their lives due to this strike.
This is something to congratulate you so much and it is a matter that goes through our country. There is no other way to finish this conflict, but those involved have a must to sit on one table like our country's benefit and its people.

For now, if you see his colleague, he is the one with a mistake, therefore, each side has been there, there will be no winner, like the nation, all of us are unable to fail and we are unable to fail more, because our people have been unable to benefit them by lack of reliable treatment.
Basically the claims by doctors is the foundation of education and the ones that are concerned with the issues of the government is the foundation of wisdom, therefore, all the two sides can speak to them, according to the government, he has appealed to the government to stop the process, and that the implementation of the case is on the table of talks.
It is good and it is good for doctors to announce, for the benefit of our country, to postpone the strike immediately and going back to work to serve all the heart they have, while the efforts to reach the right time and the government has continued.
Because it is a matter which is a matter of losses when there is a problem of losses to the country and its people, it is a loss of money and lives.
And there.

It seems not to be not for the whole hospital but several units continue while the services in other units continue.

But this issue of "Wild Frontiers," because of the strike in the whole country has a high level of health "to the nation where KH will reach a place where we want to make our country themselves easily, due to strikes.
I have been able to write, that it is true, to be close to each Tanzanian who appears in the morning, or it is a patient or he has brothers, relatives, and friend who is a patient.
Therefore, there are millions of stem cells that will go every day and the diseases of various types of diseases are derived from our treatment services that is given by our doctors, and in our countries, the doctor is very important friend to the citizen.
It is a very bad thing, when the government comes in a conflict with doctors.
When you go into the conflict and friends of the citizens, there is no place anywhere in the world, citizens used to shivered to the doctors.
Therefore, it's a situation where the government is unable to finish his differences with doctors of the citizens through a way of talks and even to reach the step of doctors's action.
In these countries, the medical officer who was shown to the value of the tax tax and for many years, it is very important for the senior health officer, he is very happy.
And even if he was to be the assistant surgeon of the medical officer, he would also be a very important way, therefore, the heads and responsibilities, senior lawyers and their husbands.
In these countries, the government are not supposed to reach a step to pray and even put up the expert doctors. It will not happen there where all other ways of finishing the difference, and to resolve the conflicts with doctors when they already completed it.
Well, NSE, we would like to see this war between the government and the doctors came back quickly by a goalless draw.
Nasemphasized again, the biggest thing for now is for both sides in this conflict to recognize that for now the tension continues, will not give the winner, is because what is going on now, all of us, as a nation, we have been unable.
This is a time to put wisdom and wisdom for what we need to do, but the real way to start in this conflict is now being talks in the environment of taking each other, then.
God bless Tanzania, God bless Africa.
