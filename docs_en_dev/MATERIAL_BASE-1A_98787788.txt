Bagamoyo District Commissioner, Coast Province, has said it will ensure all those who were involved in reading the fire of secondary schools to be arrested and taken to the law enforcement agencies.

Furthermore, he said in dealing with fire events, they will ensure that all schools have a lot of security to prevent those actions.
