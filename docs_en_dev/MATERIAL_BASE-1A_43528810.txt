It is not in details from the Swahili language when he is in Washington, (middle) close to our listener and through this one, we are searching for more information and more explanations about the phone's sim card we will be with me in Kenya with our writer, so much congratulations to change.
In details today we start one of the report and the report of the report of the rights of human beings who are human rights.
It has been explained that your votes were stolen they had already lost their past years in the hands of the forces to deal with terrorism in Kenya, the army officers have arrested more than eight people who were involved in the stadium and despite the reports that those lost were affected by the officers.
That is also ten bodies as one of the people who had been arrested in mind and the government tried.
And added that more fear for those who reduced it is now considering that there is no explanation in accordance with human rights now, then you will talk about what we are trying to look for the coordinator of the national commission to attract human rights in Kenya.
Likewise, Mister George Mrara and George Mrara and George Mrara, has joined the and wanted to know how we will lead the first life in which these people were lost.
Kenya and maybe a person without talking before yesterday, George, the same time is the assistant in the commission of human rights in Kenya where we're with him on the phone lines I go back to you.
Thank you very much a leader.
When you go to Dar es Salaam, you will be a fact, it is not like the commission for defending human rights in Kenya, these reports are there.
.
That is due to the problem.
Research which I don't know if the commission did in the last year, where we look for cases that fell in Kenya.
Events to read the report that is not English is getting into the policies.
And in that report, there was a fight.
You shouldn't have more than fifty people and one of its disappearance, they don't know where they are until now.
And also more than twenty-five people that lost their lives in the field of Dar es Salaam, the same way we are doing with a threat of death.
And in that case the case is not presented maybe which one who can be done in this time may be a step what can you take and may you know.
For now, the step that we have taken because we like the commission we have cooperation.
Very close to each other and the one that we need to council of police issues or not to be called Mister.
When we get in Dar es Salaam, the news were done and we were able to cooperate with the council we will give information about a loss.
And take action that they will do more investigation on then.
If there are police who arrived to be taken against them.
Second thing that we have done is that we have met the chief inspector of police.
When we get in Dar es Salaam city, I saw the inspector general of police and we saw them.
In events of our research, we don't know that there are some Kenyans who say that their family is found.
And we saw it?
Ras Makunja has said the police need to be on the front line to ensure that they are doing research or they are doing the investigation to ensure that those who have received report from the commission.
Ras Kiduku is happy, according to the law that is in Kenya.
Why is one?
