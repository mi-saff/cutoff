Right now they do not see Emmanuel Okwi?

At the same premier league as a player with the great value, Ugandan, Emmanuel Okwi has been one of the spectators with a big value in the world, Yanga has gone into a question that its submissions are open, Okwi is the Eindhoven mid-fielder who plays for Simba team.

Why Yanga is in Yanga if he was playing for Simba SC team from Uganda for a six months contract from Eindhoven mid-fielder Emmanuel Okwi on his part, claims that the Ugandan striker failed to pay her money as it is required by Simba to claim that their payments were given by Eucharist.

Okwi was allowed to play for Villa in order to protect his level, and he did not have a player who will be given to play for Simba soccer team for the players of the African Champions League for the Tanzania Mainland Premier League, because Yanga will be rigged.

Yanga has signed Okwi, while they have promised to believe that they are correct that they believe Okwi is a free player or Aston Villa, but he was supposed to play for Villa for six months but he will serve his use until when they get explanations from FIFA, the Football Federation in the world.
Yes, there are correct because FIFA is the one that made that player to win Villa for six months while his cases involve yourself.

FIFA, they can allow Okwi to play for Yanga for running his talent. But they can also understand if you will know that this player has violated Yanga, but there are also players who joined the FIFA.

Perhaps, Yanga won't use Okwi on the front line, but for now, he is the legality of that player as a person, when Okwi will be forced to hold their stand if they don't know where Okwi will be a permit for selling Okwi for Yanga team?

Each other is a rumor and his lawyers, Mister Samatte, but the lawyer of Okwi can be a lot, with mental disabilities, by getting an agreement with Yanga's mother, saying that Yanga's property will be put so that if Yanga will face Emmanuel Okwi if maybe here is where there is a primary issue.
