The laws of the pension funds in the Social Security Fund have been removed and now every public servant who wanted to relocate its benefits to another fund or relocate the employment he can do so.

The minister in the office of the Prime Minister Policy, Parliamentary Affairs, Labor, Employment, Youth and Children, Jenista Mhagama said that in parliament yesterday that a public servant who wanted to relocate for its benefits will be allowed in accordance with the law and even if he will decide to relocate employment.
He said the retired judge who wanted to continue contributing to the pension fund can go to speak with the fund and continue getting services being out of employment without disturbance.
Mhagama was responding to a question by the member of parliament of Korogwe Town, Mary Massay (CCM) who asked the government that it has a strategy to remove other problems since the PSPF fund has been looking for Tanzanians for their benefits.
