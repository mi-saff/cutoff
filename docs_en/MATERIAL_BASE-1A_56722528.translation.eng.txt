rabbit diseases are few and easy to deal with
by Mwangi Muiruri
according to Miss Lucy Ndung'u who is the assistant manager of rabbit raring farm of Sigona, rabbits are not largely infected by diseases.
it's only caused by exposure to cold environment and also that of diarrhea.
"the right way of avoiding costs of treatment concerning those diseases is just to ensure the environment where the rabbits are kept is not cold or dump," she says.
even so, when faced with infections it is easy to treat them because 50 rabbits will cost you only 70 shillings.
"that is the price of the medicine for destroying those two diseases with one shot.
those medicines are for fighting and countering bacterial attacks causing those diseases," she says.
she says the project of rabbit farming is among the easiest to sustain its cost because even the food is estimated to cost 15 shillings daily for 20 rabbits.
"that is the price of food considering that you will be relieved of the burden of looking for fresh greens from the garden for your rabbits," she says.
other normal danger on rabbits is invasion by flesh eating animals among them are dogs, squirrels, cats and even snakes.
to avoid such dangers, the rabbit shelters must be strong and without spaces that may let those dangerous animals to get in and attack.
the other enemies in the rabbit project are the human beings who like reaping where they did not sow and they may conspire to steal your rabbits.
"solution to that is to be keen on safety of the that project where you may keep cruel dogs, fence round the rabbit shelters and if possible connect that fence to electricity and also install hidden camera the types of CCTV," she says.
