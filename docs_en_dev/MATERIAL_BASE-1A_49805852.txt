The bus transport services will go to different provinces in the country has increased from the needs of the service.

However, those needs should be mentioned to have been directed to have media houses that do not meet road safety because of the presence of buses that do long and short time, so as to be satisfied with the ability of those stations especially buses to carry passengers and travel especially a long distance.
For several years now, we have witnessed an increase in road accidents that are caused by carelessness of drivers or poor organs of the fire equipment, a situation that causes the nation by losing strength and also to stop the families with mental disabilities.
Despite the road safety laws, some of the drivers have been owning a sharp object in addition to ensure that those buses get safe, the inspection authorities, including the Surface and Marine Transport Regulatory Authority (SUMATRA), are supposed to introduce himself and it's why they should be resolved after doing their journey.
I believe that the inspection will enable the presence of buses that are going on long though they have the ability to go through a short way, thus causing passengers and accidents or different meanings that can't be in place, for example the spoiling and vehicles every time and be forced to protect themselves on the way.
There are buses that have been allowed to travel for a long distance, an example from Arusha to Dar es Salaam which is a distance of 600 kilometers, though his ability is to travel few kilometers for those.
There are some buses that traveled to different provinces while it seems not clear that they have no ability, a situation that has not been discovered and caused others to ask ourselves if the authorities involved in the quality of quality and the ability of those buses are supposed to be used as required.
It does not mean that those buses do not have the ability to make any journey, therefore they are supposed to be given the permits for returning the journey and not a long period of 600 kilometers or more than that issue is important, that is why I insists that the inspection has.
Other buses outside the country have a good color but the ability to make the journey were allocated, they don't know it is obvious that passengers who use those buses have a lot of noise especially considering their property and also being in danger, because many of their property are also in danger.
It has been common to see that the passengers that is supposed to travel for two or three hours comes from six hours after getting married after a long distance.
I have advised the buses that are following the regular inspection, so that it is not supposed to do a long journey to be very short and let them continue to provide care for a long distance not, it should endanger the lives of passengers at accidents that can be avoided.
The traffic police are doing their work well, passengers have a good opportunity to warned drivers not to control their lives by running their lives and also they have a responsibility to give information about the whole issue of the buses that they use to travel if they will be damaged by time to time.
The aim is to inspect the inspection authorities to inspect them well before enabling them to do a short period or long time, I would like to be understood that, an inspection on the ability and knowledge of the drivers is not supposed to be a ticket for the passengers' safety in a journey, but even the quality of those buses will be required to make it taken.
