I want to continue giving condolences to the citizens of Kagera province and the Tanzanians in general.
On the earthquake that is facing the provinces of the Lake Region, Honorable President Magufuli was supposed to be on Instagram.
For the school he was swearing in Honorable president of Zambia.
But the end of that is to show that the government have been able to return this issue and a great opportunity for the past term, then we know if we are members of parliament and we should choose a panel of member of parliament.
Part of attacking our colleagues of tribe here in the municipality of Bukoba are happy to like the cause of the government's efforts to give an issue up to each.
It is seen that the government has not yet been done.
And the government says stakeholders from foreign and local stakeholders continue to contribute to a good thing, but the government has not knowing the challenges that face our people who were scored, and this injured is not present in the picture.
This is what we are supposed to make us live.
I request to clarify.
Most of the iron sheets to all the citizens do not want to do if he said my colleague.
Listen to these hearts.
And it's not that we are supposed to have all the honor to the citizens, but we are in the whole day today, if you see the prime minister he had gone to Dodoma but any way it's going to tell citizens about things that concern them on their government.
Because their lives like we cannot say that here in parliament.
I request for him to be defeated after speaking to media houses and I am also a very difficult time to join up with the topic giver.
To contribute to that, so many of us today for the purpose of victims of this incident, you believe that we have coughing, even our colleagues in Kagera province and the neighboring provinces are some of the people to take care of this area as a area of wanting to get treatment in this area.
It's not true that a human being of Swahili we have our sins related to left, then the support of right, do not want me to say that if the nation we should thank God that our colleagues would be able to be bad but it's still the president and it has Bluetooth.
In that disaster they want.
Hayatou, have arrived at a girls' primary schools and the government is still continuing with me, where three houses for teachers have collapsed.
I went to a modem or injections that is very disturbing and so there is no big house in the municipality between ten houses in the past seven, we are looking for international donations so that I am able to ensure that I am involved in the streets to give those machines.
This argument being supported by members of parliament for now, I commend the reports that they agree with that argument of him.
They did not agree with that one to talk about him.
Those are shillings.
Who said that they have won all those allowances for today's members, members of parliament will contribute to the disaster of our brothers of Bukoba.
Honorable Lukuvi.
This is that you will be buried and the government has been taken by the government for sure that it does not know if the prime minister did not get here to parliament.
Wealth of the public.
There are services not done, Honorable president to guide the new constitution in the country to do well when you go well, if you check the two, you can be able to see this matter like the government we are taught.
Today we cannot start building our houses and we need to expertise to get out of the areas that are available to be built.
I met with putting them today cases of other things, therefore there are a lot of things that are being done under the low level up to him, he would be able to bring a child to all the government and think about them and also Mister.

I have a pain so much.
In a way it has been looking for its children, I know there are some children, we will continue to partner so that we vie for the same time, the ones who passed away from the Almighty God is not supposed to get the soul of alcohol.
