university students have been appointed as good ambassadors by providing community education on the sustainable millennium goals, to enable them to recognize and participate in their work.
the statement was issued by UN Secretary-General and Director of the United Nations Development Agency (UNDP) Tanzania, Alvaro Rodriguez, at the 17th Millennium Development Goals workshop for students of the Theofilo Kisanji University (TEKU) of Mbeya.
Rodriguez said university students have a great opportunity to spread the education of the Millennium Objectives if they decide to enable the community to understand them and thus it will be easier for stakeholders to achieve the goals and ultimately the thirst for the world to achieve that goal is achieved.
one of the most stressed on goals to reach the community include climate change, which he said the community should be integrated into environmental management to avoid the adverse day-to-day effects due to the damage being done.
he said it is important that the community recognizes the importance of maintaining the environment since doing so will help to slow down climate change which will have a profound effect on current and future generations.
climate change has not impact on the current and future generation.
the community must recognize the importance of maintaining the environment and recognizing this need it is necessary for intelligent people to make known the plans for the present world.
students can do this because you are from the community, said Rodriguez.
