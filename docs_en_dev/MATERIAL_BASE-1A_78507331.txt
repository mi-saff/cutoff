Drug abuse is a topic that has been seen in the media for a long time.

And various research about the effects of drug abuse, research are aiming at checking the loopholes used to bring in domestic chemicals in the country, the size of the business owners for the country.

However, in addition to many research and various recommendations of the researchers, about the steps of taking so as to avoid the problem of the use of climate change in the country, still every time we are witnessing on how the problem progresses.

It is true that for instance, we cause a big problem of very dangerous disease that is known as usual, it does not tolerate any shame is a very dangerous disease where it makes him a patient to be dependent on those drugs and not removing them from a sober mind.

One person who fail is proud to think about another normal person and still live in his own world that he joins her in the community of work in the community.

But when we are looking for ways to fight with importation of cooperatives, in the country, it is important to look at inside here in the country because there is a group of people who are most affected by what we are derived from what we are produced from what is infected.

It is true that for instance, for your family's life for instance, it is a big business that is affected all over the world. Moreover, for that offense, it is a very big business that can produce billions from billions of money and the ability to buy anything which is together with their freedom.

But when we're very happy to make noise about events of that party from outside the country, there is a problem that doesn't use it as required and to be discussed in it is that which I said there about shame, that comes from alcohol.

I have ever released last year that in my village living in Zuxine Mponda, North West, there is a disease that is called on this section, this is a disease that comes from alcohol.

There's a shame of the alcohol problem has been a great problem in our community. This is not a secret issue because leaders know that he knew that instead of looking at the drugs they do if there is no problem.

Statistics of the researchers say that there are approximately 300,000 shillings even so, those statistics don't see if they involve the shame of alcohol, the problem that has now spread across the country.

A very high level with 35 percent from 35 to 45 percent are done without following the law, regulations and procedures and everyone who stop paying him or a shop for salt and oil to sell alcohol.

As a result of the selling of drinking alcohol, the animals will be sold at the bar due to ease of availability of alcohol every time and therefore, doing that drinking alcohol may not be understood.

The government is required to take quick action to fight with this problem by checking the issue of packaging.

At the moment there are different alcohol conducted at 150 plastic chairs to 500 shillings and the packaging is easy to sell and therefore, you can't found one person to carry up until 1000 shillings which is one acre of alcohol.

Great alcohol does not be dealt with like beer, alcohol have the procedure of using our people who use these alcohol what are not following the procedure and for sure they are drinking alcohol if they get pregnant and others.

The act of drinking alcohol like the normal alcohol is very dangerous and can cause it just a shame, but even the deaths, but this is an issue that has a certain amount.

The government is supposed to pave way for permission that gave the Quran not to be known as one of the steps to reduce easily and drinking alcohol.

Furthermore, the availability of easily has made even groups that are allowed to get more easily and at the moment there are alcohol with good flavor, good flavor and how it makes the school children to get them and use it.

To remove plastic chairs will help in a large extent to reduce the availability of high alcohol. In addition, the step will help so much in reducing the environment that currently has been affecting all over the country from the city to the villages.
