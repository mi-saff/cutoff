Collaborative security to be taught in fighting and transporting it.

It has been written by Shadrack Sagna.

I was heard of 12th October, 2016.

Many areas in the city of Dar es Salaam, for now is not safe to live.

Those actions have done people to live very worried because there is no incident that police have tried to remove it off or even remove it before it happens.
Apart from that robbery, using fire weapons, but there are also groups known as transporting the road and Black Americans' and many others have been a big threat to the residents of Dar es Salaam as a result of making criminal acts without any fear against the media.
Since May the year of May this year, these groups that use traditional weapons like a lot of death, swords, buckets, color have been a big threat in the areas of the outskirts of Dar es Salaam and despite making looting, also have reduced people who are suffering from swords and swords.
An example of the day before yesterday in Mbagala was reported to be one of the groups that was accompanied by the People's Defense Force (TPDF), Jeryson Malmo, who got huge injuries on the head and was forced to be admitted at the Lugalo Army General Hospital.
Malilo has been identified while entertaining at work at night, despite the Israeli soldier but also many citizens have already discovered one way to get income and killing two people and killing two people.
Such events like police are coming out to those areas already the people had already been affected or injured being affected by land has been done.
But there are other groups that are running conflicts in the evening in different areas, these are also set aside even in the bar so that the project can get anything and believe that people who go to the bar are those who have money.
There are also other groups of their crime, at night, they have forced many people to reduce the residence of those people when they are capable of getting any amount of money, mobile phones, television and the computer.
These groups of the youth have already confirmed because there should conduct looting or invading people's residence on night, the behavior of people in Dar es Salaam have no fear of giving the support which have contributed to do these groups be successful.
But also the lack of security including the one of the police in many areas have caused the youths to do their crime for more freedom.
Many areas in the city of Dar es Salaam have no police stations and for example the residents of Kivule-Kitunda Ward which is in different areas of the area.
My advice is that area located in Isikizya area which has more than two wards, located in Kivule-Kitunda Ward and Msalika as the police to be responsible for 24 hours more than the current police station located in 12 o'clock in the evening.
This is dangerous and give the loopholes to these groups to do their crime and even other areas outside the city like Mbweni, it does not have the police station to depend on top, something that is very dangerous to the security.
The chairmanship that was given at that time, Said Mwema, by recognizing the danger of police seen to be able to withstand the area by crime in a large extent reduced, but to leave the presidency, it is known that he has left and participatory.
I advise that the control of these crime groups is that there should be stable security, the police are encouraged to strengthen security in our neighborhoods so as to get people to cooperate with the police in making security of citizens.
