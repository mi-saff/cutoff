this mom will kill me, every time she wants something she escapes her husband and call me to a hotel to take care of her
this mom in the picture wants to kill me just a little boy, I met her in Mlimani City at The Game she was doing shopping with her little children the things she had bought were many so I helped her take them to her car, thanked me and asked for my phone number, from there on we were communicating but as the days went by we found ourselves chatting about love and one day we met and gave her 3 doses of power, it is now getting worse because every week she looks for me twice I give her things she says that her husband cannot do, she always pays the hotel with everything till the drinks I work my doses, I have tried to investigate her and realized she is a famous politician's wife here in Tanzania.
I am worried by fearing for my life while still young and I am looking for life.
I ask for advice...
