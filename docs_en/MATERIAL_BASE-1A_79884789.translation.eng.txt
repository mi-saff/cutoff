lady refuses boyfriend to be shaved by a woman
by Lewa Jefa
a lady from this neighborhood caused a stir when she invaded a barber shop and chased out her lover who had gone to get a shave, claiming that the place was full of ladies who seduced men in the pretense of massaging their heads after being shaved.
we are informed that in that place there is a section where customers are shaved and another where their heads are washed and massaged.
according to our informant, all barbers in that room are male youth but those who wash and massage customers are beautiful ladies who only wear bras and shorts.
to get shaved "it is very rare to find the place without customers because every time men flock there to get services and others to stare at the beautiful ladies as they work," said the informant.
on the day of the incident, the lady arrived there noisily and found her boyfriend in the process of being shaved.
"she started yelling at him and called him a lady in public, for falling into the beautiful ladies trap.
the staff and the supervisors of the place were forced to take immediate action to avoid more drama in fear of being muddled by that lady and told her to stop spreading gossip about their business," said the informer.
