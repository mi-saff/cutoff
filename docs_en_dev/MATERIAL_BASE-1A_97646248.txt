The commemoration of the world people with albinism in the world which are expected to take place on December 3, this year in Dar es Salaam, have been postponed and now every province will celebrate together to reduce costs.

While giving a statement of the completion of those commemorations, the Minister of State, Office of the President, Regional Administration and Local Government (Tamisemi), George Simbachawene, has said the request of the district council is to bring members of parties for people with disabilities so that they do that commemoration in Dar es Salaam.
He has said the instructions that were given by the Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa for the heads of provinces is that instead of the national commemorations to collect people with all disability in the provinces of Dar es Salaam they do in their provinces.
"I take this opportunity to urge the heads of provinces and heads of districts and directors to ensure that they provide enough cooperation from the party so that they can make those commemorations," said Simbachawene.
He has directed the Provincial Commissioner of Dar es Salaam, Paul Makonda to ensure that in the area they had planned to make the activity by giving them a donation that will not be used.
Simbachawene said that the situation will help reduce the cost instead of all they could have been transported from the provinces and go to Dar es Salaam and now they are going on in provinces and district.
