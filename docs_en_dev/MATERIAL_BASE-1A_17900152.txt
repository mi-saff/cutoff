We did not end the year to give birth to hatred and disputes against Rayo Vallecano.

One of the things that we will need to do so much when we are heading to the year 2008, the action was done we will like people and like the country.
If you follow the expansion of the debate about good administration (best leadership), which is a good and important thing, there are things that we have to deal with them as usual.
We have never explained so much the issue of corruption and now the place is clear that the expectations of citizens cannot be for the environment and the system of dealing with the concerned problems which has been used in use.
In the years of 1980, the former prime minister, Edward Sokoine was seen to be very successful in dealing with albinism "and" a system used to address the problem had a primary shortage that is causing even some of the economy, "it is noted that they had decided to be bullied.
And there was also a problem of building a long lasting problem in the environment of the same environment, suddenly it was seen and even to start the concept of the concept that the ones that are involved in entrepreneurship did not meet the economy.
It was built by various crops being put up by people in accordance with their public picture that was has been built.

It is clear that, since the beginning of the year 1990, the nation of Zanzibar left the national request for what we had to love our country more than other things we will begin to love our country, but we will start using our country more, and we will begin to love our villages, I will begin to love our villages.
Its results, some of us have no sure that there are many among them, if you see the soldiers who are in that employment, we will be ready to return to the front line if a day we came and went to war.
I have decided to believe that that day they receive, Yuda and those who said for sure they are not forgetting and we said the war does not concern them and their families and leaving their families being faced with the results of the war.
I remember that the terrorists is swelled by two sides in India on the way the head of the air force of terrorism was found in a hat trick, got a ring on a hat that was shot dead in the hotel and was killed in a bullet.
The television warned him for the time he was looking for the purpose of joining his youth to enter in one hotel of Tauro Port and just after the police continue to remove his body in danger.
I have also remember the head of the fire fire unit in the United States on September 11, which he made in, African, and ended up inside one building which was being built on fire by the provincial head, followed inside that building just after the building.
These events say that the behavior of a citizen has shown his great love for the national interests and the great gift than his soul in the country, and we can agree that there are reasons for making sure we enable them to have love with their country at any environment, without relying on it or not a validity of their love?
So, we can inform us that those we have given priority to make great decisions on our behalf as citizens have a true love for our country to an extent that they have already been unable to die for the broader interests of the public?
How many gods are among those we have given priority and they have reduced by their actions, without considering it, that they have a lot of patriotism and anyone who are in the eyes of the public?
And if their actions are questioning the patriotism of them, there are reasons that made them get into the qualifications of representing us or to lead you?
So, is the difference of a long time or it depends on the basis of what makes us benefit?
So, those who passed is a solution of patriotism is things or things (the gift) which give you the strength of love and to appreciate their country at any time without relying on it or get into him?
So, these different meanings are evident in the among the different groups in the surrounding areas like to get to an extent in our community today are making sure that we are doing their group, and we must win them in the war that started under the group D.
As we continue to discuss different issues that I had explained about the nation, there is a high fire in our community and we have not prepared the fire to the necessary weight.
Already there are people who have started putting up in the box, and the situation is now no difference, and how it started in Rwanda, while the citizens when they decided to be sold to each other with his origin.
Today, Tanzania has already been introduced, they are a certain group.
And close to each Tanzanian will be forced to be forced (or get forced) to get into a certain group depending on the stand or personal interests.
It is not the aim of this column which affects the misunderstanding but there are some effects that now there are groups of contraception?
There are two things that can arise from the first time is like we like the nation to sit down with our differences including primary and those of getting married, we need them to know how we believe that we will not hesitate to fight again.
In this debate, we make sure that we get transparency and good intention to bring the first the country instead of going and insisted that the groups and interests are, but it is okay, wrong, amen.
But this debate does not end in the talks.
This debate should ensure that we come back in our curriculum from nursery up to universities to invest in children and our youth ethics in order for the work of corruption so that the work of corruption should not be high as it is.
The second issue, which we request it will end far, it is why we will continue to stimulate the fire of hatred and hostility that we decided to go among them due to our income and we will arrive there, we will start being affected.
In this second floor of every group, it will be led by bad luck, then we will also take this country back to me, the history will put a lot of lot about our contribution concerning our contribution in polluting the peace of this country.
