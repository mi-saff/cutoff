For close to hundreds of residents of Dar es Salaam and others from the provinces and even outside Tanzania, were coming out to the International Trade Exhibition of Dar es Salaam, popular as the Saba Saba exhibition.
As they read, at this 20 years, and more, last week, they will agree that it has increased in every way the number of countries participating in organizations and companies have been given the first to the last day at the Mwalimu Julius Nyerere Grounds.
With any standards, the big step has been taken to the same time when the 38th exhibition of Saba Saba of this year 2014.
It is because of the big progress made, we have no congratulations to the organizers of the Saba Saba exhibition this year for the good work that was done, for preparations and sure of participation in business people, the country, companies and different organizations.

We've heard, last week, the Prime Minister Mizengo Pinda, wants the need to educate themselves more at the Saba Saba exhibition so as to put him in the country and they get more than it is now.

He also proposed that it was not good even at the exhibition, to be able to expand the area and make the modern market to make the country, the public and private companies, organizations and more people.
Without doubt, when it has come to think about this issue, Prime Minister Mizengo Pinda said that all of them is good, the ones that are good, us should strive to support the prime minister, Pinda in the proposal.
In addition to the growth of the Saba Saba exhibition, there are issues that have not been done well, there are many areas that do not have a chance to go to attend the exhibition of our colleagues in order to implement those instructions by the prime minister, Pinda.
