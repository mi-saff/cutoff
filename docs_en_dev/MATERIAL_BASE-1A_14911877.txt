The economy is taking place in DR Congo.
Dec 22, 2016.

There are signs of believing that the situation can be filled by bad luck in the neighboring country of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).

The problem that is present is that that nation was found to do his elections in accordance with its constitution this year, but because of what the opponents of President Joseph Kabila is needed to pay for him, the election was postponed.

What is happening now in DRC is another blow in democracy of the African continent, if there is something, something that has come back in Africa with the speed of these days is that the behavior of the leaders failed and insisted.

The first one, we would like to advise it is that the citizens of DRC have the right to pay the fate of their country without integrity and any foreign countries.

However, the truth that is open is that the citizens of Congo will not be left with anyone who wanted them to stop their fate, as it has been for approximately 50 years ago.

Yes, in a very unique way, if our government will get to be left behind or be called by things that are going on in that nation.

Economically, DRC is among the important business partners in Tanzania according to statistics of last year, DRC and Zambia alone, they are participating in goods which is prepared by using the port of Dar es Salaam by more than 70 percent.

When the situation is so, they will be identifying that other big users of our port, Burundi, and them are in violence, something that has affected the business person.

For now, we have decided to follow the name of Diplomacy, we think Tanzania cannot accept to be left behind while others seeking a solution for a short period of one and a long period of DRC.

I believe that there are people who are going on in that country for now (although it is on the right), because the end of the day, our customer is supposed to be the nation of DRC.

As such, we are supposed to be responsible, because of our economic interests in DRC, the truth that the biggest problems of the refugees will come to us, to ensure we are participating in ensuring things are not close to them.

This is because the neighboring country is growing, you are not safe.
