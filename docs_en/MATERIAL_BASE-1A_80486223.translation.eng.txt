Assistant Minister for health, social development, gender, the elderly and children doctor Hamis Kigwangalla has led a task force in a search for industries that make fake alcoholic spirits, including viroba and others and nabbed a fake factory that is in Sinza in Dar es Salaam.
Doctor Kigwangalla has said that the search being conducted by that ministry in conjunction with the Food and Drugs Authority (TFDA) has nabbed a fake factory that manufacturers the viroba, konyagi, Smirnoff and Zedi brands of alcohol that is in Sinza.
"we are conducting this inspection in conjunction with a government squad so that we can eliminate illicit alcohol that are manufactured haphazardly and without following quality standards in the development and health of Tanzanians," explained the assistant minister.
moreover, Doctor Kigwangalla has added that in that search they have nabbed the factory together with material used to make illicit alcohol such as konyagi bottles, bottle tops, labels, sachets and other materials used in making alcohol.
Doctor Kigwangala has said the search has disclosed that the manufacturers use local brews and spirit in making hard liquor, something that is very dangerous to the health of Tanzanians especially youth.
in that search, they also arrested shops that sell that liquor in the regions of Mwenge and Manzese in Dar es Salaam under the supplier Yusuf Kalambo, a resident of Kimara who is currently being sought by the police force for more investigation.
also, Doctor Kigwangalla has commanded operators of those shops to close their shops immediately and be held by police until when investigation will be complete so that the law takes its course, otherwise to be fined or invalidate their business licenses.
he said that the work of searching for industries that produce hard liquor is done by the ministry in association with TFDA and the police will go on until when fake products will disappear in the country.
