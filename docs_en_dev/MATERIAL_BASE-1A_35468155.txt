Those violating the law in Zanzibar will be allowed.
President of Zanzibar, Doctor Ali Mohamed Shein recently has warned the people of Zanzibar especially youth about dangerous and effects of not respect the law while in Pemba met with citizens in the celebrations to commemorate 52 years of Revolution and warned them who broke the law that the end of the day they will be self-employed in problems.
He said the security agencies especially the police force are not allowed to taste the people, but it doesn't have patience and people who are smoking the law.
This is a good advice to parents to the youth and especially the leader of the country because the law must be unable to do so on the excuse of breaking law is removed.
If the citizens do not see the law it is bad and it will not know what is required is to resolve the questions and build the argument of wanting to use in use.
However, we should not tell you that the issue of respect the law of the country is about every citizen and the guest of honor and we are not supposed to sell out of great and small businesses, rich and poor or the love for the political party or the soccer club.
The problem that is in Zanzibar and that is seen to be engaged to or else the necessary weight is to be used to control the existing laws.
This trend has caused some people to feel such as Zanzibar, there are people who are on the law and they have the right to appeal to their colleagues in order to maintain their colleagues.
It is not only once or three or three have heard the reports of people in their council of talks being attacked and being beaten without a reason.
There are some who used them to have many hospitals and in all these events, there is no one person who was arrested and held legal action.
The list of events of this kind is long as some of the council has been broken into the excuse of making it better when the ones that are near them were not touched.
Here is alleged to have been used for political parties and not law of the country.
All of us remember that several events of the journalists of Zanzibar fell and even shot.
At the same time, one radio station that is in Unguja Island was attacked by those who are accused of hooligans.
When the presence of a situation like this one do not speak, this the laws of Zanzibar are supposed to be allowed to have only a group of some people and it is permission to be given by others?
If he said, the law should not be remembered, but the need should be in every person and not there is a person or a group of people seen to be about the law.
Also, it is important for the law to be doing that the work that caused the charges to be supported by the government is accused of being carried out quickly as required by the court.
Here, it is not true that someone who is going to be a suspect, any one that was forced to be forced to be a lesson if it was wrong when he was surprised by the court.
Therefore, a bond of the accused of various charges to each other, are usually the right of the defendant with the conditions of bail while some of at times are given instructions of bail which is same as told that the defendant does not have a right to get bail.
For example, we are saying that we have the right to put inspiration of bail is the servants of Don Bosco, because the people of Zanzibar have divided into tithes one are those who don't work in government.
This is not a little right and it does not give the release of a good system of law and good administration. It has been accused of complaints on corruption, some people continue languishing in the past years while we heard the investigation is not completed.
This situation is very worried about good governance and important issues of laws that cause this trend by making us tell ourselves, "the right time has been given," that is the right time to be sold at all.
In order for the law it should be able to make efforts by citizens to have faith in the law, it is a must that you have been done and there are no injustice to be done from any person inside and outside the court.
The system of people having the courage and decided to take their differences and then make bad people is against the law and it is not allowed.
The explanation that those who do that are hooligans and therefore, people do not accept even when they get married or their houses were not acceptable.
In Pemba Island there were a huge destruction of houses being destroyed, farms for people were attacked and severe pains.
The issue is who especially the ones that were involved have been said about those events and what have been witnessed is a silence like that which occurred are small things.
These are saying this and those who are saying that some of the accusations that are heard are heavy and they are measurable.
It is good to see the weather condition and the truth of this issue is not known, it's not good that it was made of a free commission, not by the people of Zanzibar, to serve the truth alone so that to investigate it is not involved.
By doing that is everything he will have faith that Zanzibar laws do not discriminate anyone and anyone who does not lie on this excuse or not.
While we celebrate 53 years of Revolution, whose aim is to put the state of citizens the same as to eliminate discrimination or passport of any kind, it is good to make an evaluation on how the law are working in Zanzibar.
That evaluation should have a broader scope, in order to finish the law, but even the employment opportunities are offered by the government.
Another thing is an issue of the provision of national identity cards in Zanzibar, this needs to be looked upon in details and to have for the terms of reference to be able to eliminate complaints on provision of identity cards.
Among these things we want to be looked upon in details, it is why until today thousands of people who were born in Zanzibar and have never been expelled from Zanzibar when they have never been expelled from Zanzibar when they have never been expelled from Zanzibar.
Lindiwe Ntshalintshali has condemned people who have moved to Zanzibar in the recent years and they don't have the cemetery of their parents in the islands of Zanzibar, he is supposed to have national identity cards to be the president of Zanzibar more than their colleagues who were born with right.
The government thought that there are many people who were given identity cards against the law, but we have not heard of the one or those who have taken place legal.
When it has come for every issue to look at all the two sides of its currency and if possible even at the basis of the currency instead of waiting for one to blame to another.
