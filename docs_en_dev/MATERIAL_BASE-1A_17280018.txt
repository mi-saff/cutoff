Why Nape is still ongoing.

?

Every person gets stranded, this is an old phrase, which people of Swahili are lucky to be with them in our Swahili language.

This means that if it gets good, then you will know that you will get good and if it appears to do something, then you will give you good but you will do that problem then?

That is the way for the former minister of information whose appointment was revoked in March this year by President John Magufuli.

I am not very happy to Nape but for other people seen as a man and seems to be a man and I seems to be a man and I was not pleased with it, because every person gets that he had gone up and he does not get it.

Since his appointment was appointed, Nape seems to be a person who has married and you can see that if you follow on social media networks especially the Twitter network.

He seems to be carrying several decades ago and to show it is in which way he used to fight with his party and some of the problems they saw like what is not seen, it is like a certain style of breaking the foundation stone on what is affecting the bus.

Why to me, Nape is not?

He can be a man of his soul or in his position but not by Almighty God, I am saying this because since the beginning of the list of drugs and users in the country, when I saw the war of two bulls "later, when I saw the war of two bulls" later, when I saw the fight for two bulls "and television station.

It's a war that got people seen as the umbrella of Human Rights, but there were private issues, truly I think it is a suspect said "the former prime minister, Edward Lowassa about people going round with the party's brand, Edward Lowassa about people going round with the party's reputation.

Why is it not pleased.

He is one of us who likes to see a person being paid tax without working together with the work he made?

This one who was a parent of, Makabe, when he was returning to parliament "live," this one who was taking the news bill, Mzindu said that this one who was returning the media will win even after a hand goal again, this is the one who are facing them?

This is the one who is waiting for the sin?

Almighty God, we have been able to thank you so much and that is all the years we have been levels of politicians, while our economic condition is continuing to be bad, have never been a bad disease.

Many politicians, especially the ones who do not have positions for leadership and to see if those positions are very permanent and they believe that until now, there is a place to go again, therefore I advise them to respect the citizens without caring about the opportunity.

Recently, I ever heard as Lowassa and Sumaye they can speak about the police as he tried to ask the former secretary general of the Chama cha Demokrasia na Maendeleo party (CHADEMA), Doctor Wilison A. Slaa is the authority that he did not forget yourself.
