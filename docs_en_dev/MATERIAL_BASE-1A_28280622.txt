December every year it is a month who many families continue to join, because many workers do not like to take holidays and students take them to school for long hours.

As a result of that reason, many families like to travel to different areas for the purpose of changing the environment, the hosts of Kilimanjaro province, had a culture that by this month it is a must they go to them for celebrating Christmas holidays and the new year.
But in recent years, this situation has spread in all provinces of Tanzania, where the family may celebrate the holiday by parents or their brothers in the villages.
As a result of this culture, it has been improved and in many families in the country for this month of December, the bus owners in the provinces have been seeing that it is the only area of being sent quickly by increasing the fare for buses.
The fare is increasing every year from 15th of this month, due to people living in large numbers during the period, the owners of these buses will increase the fare every day according to the number of people's increase.
Those fare is true that they have been huge pain to many passengers, especially those with low-income Tanzanians, for example five years, the fare for going to Kilimanjaro or Arusha was between 20,000 and 50,000 shillings.
For those who play this month of December, they will agree with me about those fare because that I have explained there about now, it has been a culture for people from all provinces to celebrate the holiday where they were not born.
A good example is that in the main stand of the buses that took place in Ubungo in Dar es Salaam city, where in the period of starting on December 15 to 24, the buses have already been destroyed, that is the passengers have already bought tickets early.
But also there have been a dirty game to some people who call the bus agents who have been buying those tickets early with the aim of preventing them in the high price while in this period the passengers are many of the bus station because they are causing transport to go to where we are facing.
This issue that we have already witnessed for all the years ago despite three years ago the Surface and Marine Transport Regulatory Authority (SUMATRA) has shown an issue by using all the fine that has increased the price, a step that has reduced a little of that problem.
I am saying that SUMATRA has reduced a little bit about it because they inspected the fare equipment for those buses, the ones that show them have been sold at a normal price, but many citizens are complaining and swept away from the fare at a high price.
My request for SUMATRA is to ensure that it is controlling the condition of it this year.
Italy, using all ways to arrest the few people who see the citizens, being shot on tickets in this festive season, which they have done this festive season.
So as to stop this situation, it is good for passengers to give information early when they meet with that problem, though the others feel it is same because they have already prepared themselves well with the state agencies, there will be no need to pay the fare in this Christmas season and the new year.
