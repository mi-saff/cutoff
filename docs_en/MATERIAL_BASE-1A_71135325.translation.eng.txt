three servants who were taken into custody by the district Kamishna of Sengerema, Mwanza, Emmanule Kipole including Acting Director of the district committee, Oscar Kapinga have been released from custody and acted upon the order given to them by the district commissioner.
acting director together with acting district treasurer, Paul Sweya and accountant Hassan Moshi were taken into custody by the orders of the district commissioner last Wednesday after going against an order requiring them to pay Sengerema sanitation workers who had proceeded up to that committee's office.
the day before yesterday at 10 o'clock in the morning, those public servants were released from police custody of Sengerema district to go pay the sanitation workers a sum of 29,000 shillings per person even though that money didn't satisfy the thirst of those cleaners.
the execution of payment for those individuals was done at 4pm, shortly after the servants were released.
