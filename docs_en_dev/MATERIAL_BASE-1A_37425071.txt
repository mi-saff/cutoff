When he was heading to end, the ones that will go in Dar es Salaam have a lot of time, it has been continuing more than it is fighting and it's said so much.
Yes, they are struggling to vote and this is the year of two and ten thousand shillings.
Anything that is called for youths.
Now it is first to register inside and going to vote.
Because they are always in light.
I have not been reached by him, I was heard.
He changed as a leader.
Because it is not that you will not know a billion, therefore you find the youth they have no great ones.
You are as the head of the district like their fellow youth?
Say and giving thanks and because of the time of time and responsibilities you have.
It's just the first day and it has been a very important part of educating the community well that they have helped the citizens to know several several things that the nation is doing because I have been correct between the citizens and their government as they have done well and also in a matter like that.
It is complete but I would tell you just of Kinondoni.
Through you.
What do you know.
I usually have a new judge.
In the council of the court of the district.
Those who don't read it has been told I have decided to remove it because of the complaints of citizens.
If these are only one hundred dollar.
And the ability that existed in solving the case as a case.
Therefore, we are not only defenders and one hundred thousand cases?
And the size of my bus station which is five hundred thousand in Kinondoni is five hundred thousand shillings.
And this one I have one million and six hundred thousand.
There was painful to many people more than that province which have one million people and six hundred thousand shillings.
At the last time we're getting.
We are looking at ten o'clock and eight years but I promised two hundred people.
Therefore, we can say that if he told me there was a lot of conflicts until because of large numbers.
If it is true and good if he told me it is because he didn't give him in this parliament, then you can vote for them that would like to have the house.
In Kinondoni, when I was born, it is true that we are continuing to be good.
You should understand that but the second do they make it through his period of illegal immigrants.
He has also added.
I did not want to serve the citizens there are no court that are doing so that this is Kinondoni.
The goal is to make sure that the case is still not information like five patience, every time it reaches.
It will be just the same day for going under the entertainment that he is writing is fighting against it but also she doesn't know that he is going in Kinondoni, I have been awarded the lawyers.
Those who have agreed don't have money to pay him but I will have them on her salary.
The work is there is to give education to the citizens about the understanding of the family issues, the suspects are not yet to take them to the step before he has not gone to court.
To know, but the court they have.
Therefore, it is good for the citizens of Kinondoni District and all Tanzanians for understanding their benefits but we have never been successful because we are struggling to solve our road system and we have already lost their lives due to the road because there is bad behavior which could make sure that the road takes place in Kinondoni.
Which is a hundred and eight hundred and eight teams usually uses twenty teams and for instance, there are very important things to educate the community like this one is very important for us to get pregnant women and therefore we want them to get pregnant women and therefore we want them to get married but how many Tanzanians can be found and even if this two sides have already been found, it needs a religious leader.
Every person was put in place since good needs for councilors.
Last week I need to make sure that members of parliament are hard working hard to make sure you need to be easy and easy to know the importance of development.
And the right to every Tanzanian without looking at how his income is in which his wife had his ability.
To elect him in his environment and those leaders cannot get like the youth their contribution and we are saying you will be touched by them as year taken action.
There was no lot of thanks and that it would use the disease they got on night and in the afternoon but also as well as the mother of this family is called "then it is a great job.
One of the teeth that were held by the road have made people but the second one on yourself is to know how his lawyers are searching in nations to our nation and to give him the honor of that is the day.
Even if that was not done in the world it has said, giving birth to the mother by using this?
I am happy to follow.
He told me that earlier I would told him earlier.
Ras Makunja is no?
So I am happy about what even the four out of anyone that I want to sit for the purpose of encouraging the youth is in different sectors of different sectors I believe in everything he managed and things will be a true truth.
