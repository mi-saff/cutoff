the member of parliament for Kigoma Urban, Zitto has announced his intention to skip the sessions of the Kigoma Municipal Council, which are used to submit various Ward reports if the regulations and procedures for the proceedings of the sessions will not be corrected.
Zitto said in the present situation, such sessions are not productive instead, they have been like coffee and pigeon pea stones.
speaking before the closing of the session of the councilors council of the municipality, Zitto wanted to know the quarterly implementation reports of the previous session to see if the challenges and problems the councilors presented at the session had been implemented.
responding to that, the mayor of Kigoma City Municipality, Hussein Ruhava, said in accordance with the regulations, such sessions set by the ministry in the office of the president, regional administration and local government (Tamisemi) are for the purpose of submitting Ward reports and if there are things that should be implemented, they are forwarded to the standing committee of the council where they are debated.
following the answer, Zitto said he would not attend the sessions because they are not responsible in accountability.
he told the municipal director that, it is prohibited to invite him to a councilors' meeting for submitting ward reports.
the director of Kigoma Urban Municipality, Judethadeus Mboya said that the argument of the member of parliament was logical and that although the principle does not say so, they would strive to have a summary of the report on what transpired so as to explain the implementation of what was done.
