Provincial Disaster Risk Command, NPA-Nueva Ecija 16 2012, the commandos attacked the New People's Army (NPA) in a UNESCO World Cup in Barangay Burgos, Caringal, Nueva Ecija last night on March 15, in the evening of March 15, where they launched a regular combat operations in the area.

They were amazed by the successive explosion of M203 and rifle that was left inside their camp, aside from the sudden outbursts of gunshots from high-caliber guns, they were surprised to have a gunshot until the operatives got away from each other.

This is part of the campaign to file a case of 81IB, in their murder of four companions last March 9 in Barangay Manoc- Manoc, Bongolan, Nueva Ecija that they were able to conduct a fight and they were allegedly confiscated by guns to cover up their crime and internet.

This is also the response of the people against the impending damage and widespread brownout in the scope of the former Hacienda Luisita, and the community of the indigenous people, at the boundary of Nueva Ecija and Nueva Viscaya because the planned entry of the company in mining due to danger and the damage it caused in life, livelihood, and surroundings.

Just like the previous campaign military and troops of the enemy, which is owned by terrorism in our province, there is a need to expose and fight the laughters made by the foreigners and local that we can do everything so that they will be held accountable for the lengthening list of crime in the people.

We do not expect justice and real progress for the two-year-being abused by the Marcos US-Aquino to the Filipino people.
