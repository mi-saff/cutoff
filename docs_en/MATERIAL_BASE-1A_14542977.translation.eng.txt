waves had hit the ship that sunk three days ago.
"we have completed the exercise at recovering bodies inside the ship.
"officers from the navy who are divers have searched for survivors everywhere after the sunk ship floated," Bangladesh's Chief Maritime Officer Mister Shamsuddoha Khandaker told the AFP news agency.
"up until now those who died from drowning were 45."
we have searched everywhere and there is a possibility that no more bodies will be found," a chief government official in the area Mister Saiful Hasan told AFP.
chief of police in the area Mister Ferdous Ahmed confirmed the number of dead.
Hasan said that, search operations for more bodies in the River Meghna which is the widest in the world, would continue as some of the bodies might have been swept by waves to the river.
reports say that the ship had carried 350 people but when it started its journey to the South of Bangladesh the number was reduced to 150-200.
