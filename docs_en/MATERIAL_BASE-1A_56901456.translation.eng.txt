Tundu Lissu 'tastes' a hand ball in Singida East.
the Singida East parliamentary aspirant on the Chadema ticket, Tundu Antiphas Mughwai Lissu, has said that he is afraid the general election won't be free and fair claiming that the police force has been prepared to ensure he isn't announced as the winner.
Lissu has said that while talking to journalists in that region where he noted that he has gotten news through the phone from one of the region's bank manager in the city and two police, that the police force has arranged for a great force to reverse the voters decision, so that the CCM aspirant can be announced as the winner.
Tundu Lissu who is Chadema's attorney general, said during different times, he was called by two police officers including FFU, giving him the same information he was given by the bank manager.
he said that those police told him that the police force will use three caravan vehicles (which are used to pour tear gas) and a big group of police and that they've been ordered by their leaders, to ensure that no matter what, him (Tundu) is not announced as the parliamentary winner.
that aspirant said that in a normal mind, the police force should not use too much force in the region of Singida East where since the campaigns began, there has been no incident or signs of breaking the peace.
in another step, Tundu Lissu has promised that if he will be defeated legally, he will agree with the result and he will not have anything to do with it.
but if he will be defeated through dirty methods, he won't agree with those dirty results.
and the police commander of Singida region, ACP Sedoyeka, said they want Lissu because he is a lawyer, to confirm his suspicions, then the police force can take action.
in that state the revolutionary party (CCM) has stopped Mister Jonathan Njau from fighting with Tundu Lissu in this election.
