Acts of theft, robbery in Mbagala.
Abdul Fm, Mbagala.
A car model which was scored by a special vehicle, after beating up a house in Tabata Primary School in Dar es Salaam city the day before yesterday, due to the motorcycle that fell on road without being distributed in picture by Salim Bimani.
The editor, I give this call to the police force to take this step quickly because we the residents of Mbagala, Temeke District now has been a normal issue to hear them down.
Although it is difficult to know the death of those events, but we have witnessed several people being attacked and injured by being shot.
I am saying that there is a cargo of weapons that are owned by people or groups in these events.
For example two weeks ago people who had not been heard were heard, they bombed seven times and came out to these people came out in the area of Chamazi and cries of people every time after time they are complaining or not to come out of the areas they pass.
I think that police will do a operation in collaboration with the citizens to maintain the weapons because these people do not live in heaven but it's a place here in the world.
