some of the rice farmers in the district of Bahi have claimed to have contracted eye and skin infections immediately they got into the farms after the Urani company conducted a research on their farms .
our reporter Kulinge Mongi reports more from Dodoma province .
those claims were made when this station visited several of those farmers who were affected by the water available in their farms .
it was since I started here in the garden that contracted this eye problem .
<no-speech>
then I went -- I had gone to work and that problem affected me while there -- the water was sprinkling on my face .
<no-speech>
am disturbed by eyes and these eyes are not for for a very long time .
<no-speech>
I see is recently this year I have entered -- here in the garden to do rice farming that is when I saw disturbance and disturbance of -- of that type .
the problem of our water this year this dirty water when you bath you are irritated and when you drink you diarrhea mmhm yes that problem .
as a result of fear of being more affected those several farmers have feared to continue with rice farming and so asked the government in that district to provide advice on the future of that problem .
now I was asking the government wholeheartedly even though the time of planting our rice produce which we rely on is over and we are on the last phase and the rain is about to stop to make a statement .
then we come to at least plant soya beans if it has no effects at least soya beans if the rains will come back these of the last moments -- last moments .
on her side the head of Bahi district Miss Betty Mkwasa has confessed to have gotten the reports of the presence of that problem and the actions have been taken of taking the samples of water and soil to the head government chemist and up to now they have not found the results of that research .
those people -- who said that they have such problems after going to inspect in the health centers there is not even one who went -- to get treated in the -- health center or dispensary .
<no-speech>
therefore what was done they took the water -- water sample but similarly they took soil sample in order to take to the head chemist who up to now we have not gotten the answer .
from here in Dodoma am Kulinge Mongi .
