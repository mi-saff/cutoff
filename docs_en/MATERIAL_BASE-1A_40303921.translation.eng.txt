the effects of not doing the act of marriage for a long time.
hello, I wish to bring this to you; I believe you will learn especially to those without knowledge, when you stay for long without having sex, these are the effects:
frequent anger on petty issues,
more interest in viewing nude pictures,
forgetfulness,
interest in love stories,
very heavy flow during menstruation (female),
rushing into other people's businesses (a habit of involving yourself in matters that do not concern you),
headaches,
having a stiff back (male),
easy infection by the love jinn,
lose of efficiency in work,
quite easy contraction of HIV in case of unprotected intercourse with an infected person,
you can develop a new habit you never had before to be an alternative
like drunkenness etc.
