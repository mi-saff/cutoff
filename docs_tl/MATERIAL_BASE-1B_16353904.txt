Meanwhile, Eric Pineda said, Manny Pacquiao said the business manager of Manny Pacquiao that he is taking advantage of the Pambansang Kamao in his work as Senator of the country and has no plans to fight on October like the spreading news.
It can be recalled that Bob Arum of Top Rank Promotions will have reservations with the Top Rank Promotions to be held on October 15, which is possible to be filed by Pacman versus allegedly those who are going to choose to be able to choose to serve as Brila Bristol, Terrence Crawford or Danny Garcia.
Pacquiao is currently busy with his political career after being retired last year after Dadivas said that Timothy Bradley was complete.
Pineda admitted in an interview by the most wise person said to make her convince the Pambansang Kamao to go back to the ring on October for the said reserved date of fight, but Pacquiao refused because this time he was first in Filipino to serve the country as senator.
