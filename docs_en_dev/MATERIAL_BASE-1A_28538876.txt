One of the big problems of us Tanzanians are not supposed to accept when there is a person who has failed to continue.

Meaning, it is that those efforts of terrorism was done by TFF to prove to the Tanzanians that we can score against Algeria it's why I went against Algeria then I will go to prison, I do not like to citizenship, I have never been possible.

The ball has no set aside, it is a plan that is happening, TFF played with psychology and after they failed to manage their primary work and to ensure that the committee had a way to pay fees and to prove to the Tanzanians that it is possible easily by Algeria.

I will not make this results but on another side, I am happy about this to be a lesson to leaders who have a lesson to leaders, instead of managing and making a good foundation of developing our country, remain in developing Tanzanians.
