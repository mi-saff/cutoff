know ways of getting friends.
every time I write about friendship I always remember an incident of two military friends.
their squad went to war, were attacked and came back to their camp with bodies of the dead and with many injured.
one of the friend was saddened because he did not see his colleague friend even though he searched for him among all the dead and the injured.
he was saddened and went to the commander of the troop to request to go back to the battle ground to search for his friend.
the commander replied by saying, "there is no need because you won't find your friend alive.
you may even lose your life."
nevertheless, that young man continued insisting on his mission until the commander allowed him.
he went there and upon returning, he was in a critical condition.
when the commander asked whether he saw his friend he said, "I have found him in a critical state and he is about to die.
when he saw me, he looked at me with tears flowing, he held my hand and said, "I knew you my friend, will come to see me before I close my eyes.
now that you've come, I will die in piece.
then he died while holding my hand.
even though after that, I was saddened in my heart, I didn't feel. the incident of two friends.
