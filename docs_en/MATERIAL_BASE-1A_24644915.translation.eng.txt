<no-speech>

<no-speech>
in that way Singida is hot ohh .
<no-speech>
my brothers and citizens .
<no-speech>
I have been given time to explain to you what your government is doing concerning transport issues .
especially on the central railway .
<no-speech>
a railway that is not just important nationally but internationally .
the lives of six neighboring countries depend on our central railway .
<no-speech>
there are things which people are saying that we are late I want to tell you that we are not late even by one second .
we are doing what we're doing with certainty so as to be certain about the things we're doing to eliminate blame later on in the journey .
every matter is clean .
<no-speech>
honorable Secretary-General my brothers and citizens of Singida our elections' declaration for the revolutions party of the year two thousand and five explains the revival of the central railway .
<no-speech>
and that matter is being done very well .
<no-speech>
if I have time and you permit me chairman I'll talk for a whole hour .
<no-speech>
honorable Secretary-General I -- can a whole hour be found for talking ?
<no-speech>
alright I am told twenty minutes .
I'll put an effort to squeeze it but let me say what the citizens of Tanzania and Singida are supposed to know what is happening .
yesterday the minister for transport Doctor Harrison Mwakembe read the budget for the ministry of transport for the year two thousand and fourteen and fifteen .
and gave the implementation of the budget of the year twenty thirteen and fourteen .
I'll start with what happened for the last financial year on our central railway .
<no-speech>
my brothers and citizens our railway was built in the year nineteen hundred and five .
<no-speech>
it has more than a hundred years .
<no-speech>
therefore the tracks for the railway and bridges were themselves outdated .
even an old man aged a thousand -- a hundred years also becomes tired .
<no-speech>
therefore what we did at first was to repair all areas that had become old and that work is being done very well .
<no-speech>
honorable citizens up to now we have changed the railway and the old tracks that had small weights .
that cannot bear a big load .
which forces the train to go at a lower speed up to now for (()) years we have made five hundred and twenty-seven kilometers .
<no-speech>
it's not easy .
<no-speech>
we have constructed a place where the train can move at seventy kilometers per hour when it gets there .
<no-speech>
different from now where it moves at fifteen kilometers per hour in some areas .
<no-speech>
for now all those areas are this one from Tabora Malongwe area up to Dar es Salaam .
trains can move at seventy kilometers per hour .
<no-speech>
but at that section there are bridges which were worrying for training that were carrying heavy loads .
<no-speech>
many bridges that were built by the German had the ability to carry loads of thirteen point seven tons for one axle right now we have a program that continues to be implemented to raise these bridges to twenty-five tons for one axle .
three big bridges have already undergone repairs .
and one is at the border just over here in Singida province and Dodoma province Kintiku area in the middle of Kintiku and Bai .
another bridge is in Kilosa .
there are two in the middle of Kilosa and Burwe .
all these have been completed and now the trains pass over them .
<no-speech>
we are building two large dams from this year's budget to reduce flooding along the railways area when it rains .
we will build a dam in Magai and another one in Mpwapa area .
<no-speech>
the railway experts call them these two dams the decrease .
that will prevent flooding along the railway when it rains heavily .
right now we had stopped commuter trains as a result of weak bridges but a section of the railway had been uprooted by the rains .
now we don't want a repeat of this matter and that's why we are building the two dams this year and indicates that we will build five more from the next budget to make a total of five .
even it rains day and night for two years our railway will be safe .
C_C_M hurray yes .
<no-speech>
alright we now continue with the people of Tabora Kaliua Mpanda Kigoma .
the railway which is in the area I mentioned is light weight .
therefore when the trains reach Tabora they reduce speed .
<no-speech>
therefore we have put in this year's budget one hundred and -- one hundred and seventy billion for the sake of serving that area .
<no-speech>
let's change the railway .
let's put a heavier one .
let's repair the bridges so that the people of Mpanda can be reached by the train that is able to pull twenty-one up to thirty coaches .
right now the train pulls nine coaches if it goes to Mpanda .
<no-speech>
because the railway is faulty .
but there is a budget for what we're doing .
the government is giving money for the repair of that section .
<no-speech>
Tabora Kigoma we will likewise make those big and essential changes to our current railway .
I understand the people of Singida would also want to know about Manyoni Singida ?
<no-speech>
this is the information .
<no-speech>
I have come with railway experts (()) these are not playful matters as I have come with railway experts and I am here with them .
they will remain to pass through it and inspect it .
<no-speech>
it's whole but we can't start letting trains through without inspecting it .
<no-speech>
if they finish that inspection in two weeks they will bring a report and if it will show that there are no major essential repairs that need to be done we'll now start thinking of beginning a commuter train to Singida .
<no-speech>
