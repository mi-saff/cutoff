In Bulabugin.

Goaynon, what I felt when I read a small amount of gratitude for energy Secretary Al Cusi.
Secretary Cusi was given by Secretary Cusipag) which is the gift given to him by the gang-gang named Keymart Camarillo, who is known in his One Udge Bermejo, for the project of Duterte's kitchen program.
But instead of giving money to the video machines, they promised to have porridge, things and other needs for Duterte's kitchen.
Goaynon, because, we have been made a taste like this in the government official.
Most of the people that we know are taking care of a president in the position, what's first thinking about how to cover their own funds "in their pocket.
Secretary Cusi, so that the contribution to the Duterte's kitchen is very important.
If you think about it, he can just move the responsibility given by the donations for sure they will run hurriedly to the projects of the Department of energy (DOE) for this project, just go near the little bit of the President.
But Secretary Al "was not able to do that, instead of given to an animal.
A good example for the other government official.
Hopefully all government officials they have this kind of thinking if they are like that, the country is surely going to return to the government.
Keathy of Social Work and Al "Pe-called" Cusi, both two!
