Amazing.

Are you okay?

Japanese was able to catch a picture of their scattered firecrackers after their game against Ivory Coast in the World Cup, where they lost, it can be sure that there is no other country who made it, except if there would be no other country since now.
Japanese have known the discipline, order and obedience to the authorities when the earthquake and tsunami in Japan have been used while waiting for help from the government as compared to what happened in Leyte and Samar, a few hours after the onslaught of typhoon Yolanda.
But there is still something to comment on what the Japanese have done, "they say they are not used to seeing those who are cleaning their place, but they do not care if this person is being used to clean, but they do not care about those who are making a good thing.
Our culture needs to be needed in this kind of discipline on the road, it can be seen that those who are throwing garbage in the road, the government are going to be blamed if only half of the entire population in the Philippines can be blamed.
