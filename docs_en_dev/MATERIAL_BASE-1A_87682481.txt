We should leave that, Doctor Mwakyembe, Ray C will be supported.
Brightiles 21, 2013.

For a period of months and several weeks now, if the nation we have continued to hear information (which have been there for many years) about the use of drug trafficking.

There is a truth or several issues, which does not need to have a degree to any Tanzanian that could make sure that you be known and if it will be a big step in reaching this disaster.

On first, the truth is clear that for now, drugs is a problem that has affected many people especially young people in urban areas like Dar es Salaam, Arusha, and Mwanza and other towns.

If he said a musician who has been very much here in the country, Rehema Chalamila, popularly known as Ray C, made an interview at the Clouds TV station recently, many people have been badly affected by the community as others are known as others doing well in the community.

In addition to that, lack of many (it is estimated to continue 200 people) have been supported and even others were sentenced to the country like China and Hong Kong, according to different media stations in the country and in Hong Kong, our lawyers and it has been a big challenge to our nation.

The second truth about this disaster is that there is a big possibility among the most illegal immigrants in this disaster.

For instance, those who have the interest in this business have been using drugs in various parts, such as media houses and media stations in spreading the concept of dealing with this disaster is a very big network, to an extent that it is difficult to deal with it.

Those drugs want to inform the public that the state of our country is as it is in other countries like Mexico and Colyvas of the country, the presence of groups or "the army" (outside the government) for the purpose of protecting the interests of this business) and people with great and great strength.

Those with the aim of stopping the fight against this business here in the country have dared to even involved the deaths of some people that were thrown out by those people, "it has succeeded to come forward," we want jokes.

In general, even if there are cells of the truth in this claims, it is clear that they are being used by a lot of claims so as to convince many efforts to deal with this disaster.

In addition, these issues are preventing the various media stations, and even the Tanzanian community in general, they have an aim of showing that the participants of this business are on the law and that they have reached an opportunity not to be touched by any authority.

Another truth about this disaster is not supposed to be responsible for leaders who are in different levels, in the fight against this problem, there are several people who have the authorities in the ministry and other departments, but the situation has continued to be bad, this issue gives several questions.

It is possible that these authorities are among those who benefit from this business, and therefore they are participating to remove it is the same as cutting them for their own benefits, but they can be not supposed to benefit them and not knowing their duties as required.
