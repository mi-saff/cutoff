Uku was surprised by Van Persie, you will see the priest from Cindy, 22, 2012.

A big news of games last week was the issue of transfer to Robin Van Persie, to Manchester United from Arsenal.
Media stations have written that the salary of that player for a week.
It will be about 500 million shillings in Tanzania. It is a lot of money, a lot of money.
However, in the neighboring country of our country, Uganda, there is our colleague who has sent the wealth because of the only one-day work, is called Stephen Kiwuyo, a player of the nation who won the gold medal in the Marathon race of the Olympic championships this year.
Until yesterday, I have already been contributed by the stakeholders and different companies to an amount of 500 million shillings in Tanzania.
In short, to an extent that, Van Persie, gave birth through a whole week, Kiwuyo, has gone for only one day.
When you have been fined shillings, I have been redeemed by the fans and more, he has got those funds to serve his country and not a club that makes them work not by love but because of looking for livelihood.
In the next week, Van Persie, will play 500 million shillings as Kiroboto has will have to give birth to other competitions when he came out, already President Yoweri Museveni has promised that his government will be giving 400,000 shillings for every player who will make calls in his country in big competitions.
Argument that I want to break it to today, it is that there is a lot of money in the sports sector as everyone of us want to bring back their responsibilities.
If our nation has been unsuccessful in the Olympic championships, the reason for failing to happen, it cannot be Filbert Mponzi and the Olympic Committee (TOC) alone.
The explosion and it cannot be Selemani Nyambui and the Tanzania Athletics' Association because it cannot build the Indian Ocean and the International Boxing Federation in Tanzania.
However, those media stations are part of the problem and I believe it gets even a writer in the Olympic championships that took place in London City, England this year.
Even if Tanzania had only seven athletes in that tournament, it's still not on one vessel to members to report what is going on and also can learn why Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda have dropped out in games when they were in the past years.
Our media have ever been on the internet only and that is why I was surprised by one day the writer of journalists to ask you a question about why the team does exercises in Kibaha in England.
It shows openly that the author has only a great writer, he did not know that this is the drought time in Europe and that is even the Olympic championships was known as a drought season.
But if a writer has never come out or it is taken to the competition, she will know these things that this is very normal, but it is a must to be taken to them.
Today, our agencies do not report completely about the money that is swelled.
How he gets poor and woke up rich because of doing well in sports.
The youths who want to be women would send their ability and success from the Sunni rebels and the fact that the contributions for the purpose of the patient was improved and is operated by the newspaper of the Ugandan government newspaper.
Nangwanda Sijaona Stadium have been reported that for this year, the best player who brought in a lot of money in the world is the player of Jamala Africa, Msepwa.
That until now he died last year, the Kenyan mid-fielder, Samuel Wikipedia, had already got gifts worth over one and a half million dollars (approximately two and a half billion shillings) in a period of three years.
Every day all of us we will talk about big salaries that are only alone, we believe that people can be annoyed by playing many other games.
Manny Pacquiao (wearing a man) has changed the neighborhood which he left in Manila, Msines, because of the money he's swelled in the boxing game.
It is not possible that Tanzania has shown the sportsmen that this is a nation that has created athletes in a high level like 'BayArena, Nyambui, Titus Simba, Ne-fielder, Method Kimomogoro and others.
I have faith that their talents are there, many. The problem is that all of us want to be cursed or we would like to take legal action but not to take legal action.
Our government is expecting to give flag a team that wants to leave tomorrow there is where Uganda have promised to give 600 million shillings for every medal, we are also only flag!
It is a must that the government to appreciate and do enough investment in sports.
Three weeks ago, Uganda has got its first player in the Cheketua 'game since they get Uhuru and who he only plays for him here in Tanzania?
He tells you, the former champions of that game in the world, made a lot of money because of the game only, we have not been surprised and it was not played.
Our nation has ever played soccer only every day in soccer every year, every year's soccer will not be able to go to this way but it is a must for the government to take legal action against this sector.
When we get the Sunni religion, Hasheem Mkiru, and holy man, our country will partner.
These children get people and the economy will be dealt with and those living because of the strength of the economy of these sportsmen, they will respect sports.
He doesn't be criticized for everyone because of doing badly in our nation.
But I request to ask you, it is another person who is using a lot of time in developing sports here in Tanzania.
How would you help each other to get best athletes in the media stations so that they do to make people get more than soccer games?
If the news reporter does not know that this competition is ready to stand this tournament, will you help each other to get a normal youth.
If he wasn't seen and believers don't know that they are the biggest problem of sports here in the country, who will enable you to be a teaser?
