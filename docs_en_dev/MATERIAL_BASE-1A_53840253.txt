When you are planning we can improve our towns.
Yesterday we published news about the Municipal Council of Kinondoni in Dar es Salaam city, to demolish all unplanned settlements and then give them in modern shape.
Speaking to Mwananchi in a special interview, the mayor of that municipality, Benjamin Sitta said that plan is expected to start in the year 2018, is part of the development strategies of the municipality.
By starting, he said they have organized that they are unable to buy a famous bar in Tandale and strengthen the special system of modern.
This is a step to be commended because that is in Kinondoni, it is a sign of the situation in many areas in the country, basically, there are many areas in the country, where there are many areas in the country, there is a result of not increasing the towns early or the absence of poor management in areas that were affected by the existence of urban planning.
The effects of having towns that were built very well for example, areas where the map of the urban planning show have been built or for the purpose of sports equipment or check, expansion of school or hospitals or government buildings, we have witnessed buildings being attacked and built houses for living and others for the purpose of business activities.
Also, we have witnessed those who were forced to build houses in areas of road safety and maybe the availability of water and oil pipes.
The worst is that there are some of the money that were kidnapped even into dangerous parasites which produces clean water and therefore causing a huge problem to other residents because water are spread especially during rains.
We thank the Kinondoni municipal for this one that is supposed to be followed by other different areas in the country and even so, we need to ensure that this plan is sustainable and we prepare well to serve his ability.
We are saying that, especially by considering that our country has built many years for many years, but a few months ago the area will be improved and have a good example of its own years ago, until now there is nothing at the area.
Outside Kinondoni, there are many examples of the strategies to promote the cities, but up to now it has never happened two weeks ago, a good example is the modern cities of Kigamboni and Lugua.
We don't know that Mayor Sitta wants to make it popularity, it should be remembered, this is a big project and if you will put it in Kinondoni in a unique chapter in the country, therefore, it is a must for the municipality to prepare themselves because his process will need many resources.
To plan is to choose, if we have decided to improve our towns, we must have a good intention of not true, while we listen to them in our internal resources.
We don't give you anywhere, every day we will be able to plan with strategies while we were depending on a big amount of resources especially money from the sponsors or outside of the country.
In addition to that, we have said that the Municipal Council of Kinondoni, are required to see other areas in the country since we are required to see good and modern cities, but every corner of our country is expected to be available, but every corner of our areas will be completed.
