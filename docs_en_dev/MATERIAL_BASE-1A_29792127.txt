The government takes precaution on murder.
If we have done to our country to be a island of peace, we live with fear about our life, but now it is not therefore, we live like people who do not have sure tomorrow due to the killings going on in the country.
My fellow editor who is going on now in the country is not normal in the country, it has reached an appropriate step to convince his fellow Tanzanian to a animal without even what is possible, but it is not a person to take action, but it is not a person to take action against this law and to do that brutal act.
We request media stations and the relevant authorities to take stern measures against them which are planted now, it will come to become a big bomb later in our community.
God bless Tanzania and Mzalendo newspapers.
