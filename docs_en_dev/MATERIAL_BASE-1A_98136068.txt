Parents to fight the front of children is indiscipline.
Although every community has its culture, I believe in every community there is no parents who see you so much and even at each other to each children, even if parents have survived, how many children have no worries in front of small children.
It is possible that you are happy to see that it is a big problem, but any child who has lived in doing parents being affected by some ways of the growth of his child.
A bad thing is that even when even children with their marriages, you feel that they get a normal culture, because they have lived like a lot of girls or bake.
'Dude' in the same, Itagon.
