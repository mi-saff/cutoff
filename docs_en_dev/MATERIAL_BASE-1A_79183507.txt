She refuses Pickup, because of a bicycle!
Jide 17, 2013.

Emmanuel Arnold Okwi, right now is alleged to have been seen to have forgotten in the estates of the city of Kampala, Uganda, with his Eindhoven mid-fielder who went for him to vie for the team in accordance with his contract.

This is the second month now Okwi bought his home to them as an incident that it will be paid his salary by his club.

Four years ago, Mbwana Samatta, was ditering in the village of Mbagala, followed him to play for Simba club on claims that it has not bought a car as they have agreed.

Today, Samatta is one of the most popular players here in Tanzania, while playing outside Tanzania at TP Mazembe Club.

I would be able to give many other examples but that only does not tire us again.

The big problem which is facing many African players compared to their colleagues in the West and Central Africa, is how to see their achievements and how they see a big picture before them.

Samatta wanted to stop completely playing soccer because of Toyota Raqqa, which is worth eight million shillings today, he is making the money for a bonus for the international match.

But four years ago, Samatta was ready to play four matches in Mbagala Kibondemaji, where he was paid 20,000 shillings for the match more than playing for Simba and Simba, later he went to TP Mazembe!

The player gets the benefits when he comes back home for a period of two months while his team is going on with this competition and this is a matter which some of us will win completely.

By bad luck, this days has been a very small part, the others say that due to this village, it is that this news of absenteeism of Okwi are living in the whole world. There is no team or team that is ready to register players who do not have discipline.

In Europe for our colleagues, the discipline that is considered more than all is the one to participate in exercises and to follow the instructions of the teachers and even if a player has a bad behavior, if he is doing well, he can be done well.

The biggest problem with our discipline is being viewed at a very small things, you will find the leader that she gets to a player because they do not meet a player because they do not meet capital or small things.

Mistakes like Okwi will come out to cost them later, this is a mistake that he was given to the Tanzania soccer system and I think he can be able to do even in Europe.

While Simba, Okwi has never been even one time to come back to Tanzania every time when he was given a half time to them, she had already been expelled or his leaders except speaking to the people he wants.

Unfortunately, he urged the citizens to be faced with Simba and I don't think this that they can be faced with thanks where issues of discipline are close to the European standards.

Our players are what I got to Tanzania for the first time when she was sent in Tanzania for the first time when she got into a short time so that he can get a lot of good players and popular as Kadama Kenja of Ivory Coast.

What got the same way, Babu Tale and decided to stop completely the ball, because it has not been bought by bird feathers and then for now he can buy even if he can buy or not to feel like his account has reduced anything?

Simba and Estrada, that is not the end of this life is a way to pass before someone has not arrived in Liverpool and Arsenal and then went to Real Madrid and Barcelona.

This fear of our players is surprising so that Okwi has never participated in any great competition through his national team where they played the World Cup Finals which has never been even the best scorer in the premier league of Tanzania.

Yaya Toure, who is paid more than 400 million shillings of Tanzania every week in England, right now he is in training with his team Emmanuel Okwi being able to do exercises and at the same way they cannot get problems if they get problems if they get problems.

Recently, if this player started being paid more than 100 million shillings for a month, you will leave it?

If you'll get the opportunity to get more success by checking the current salary they could destroy the farm because of a bicycle.
