she is from my in-law, wife of my brother, but her jokes have gone over board.
there is a joke of you in laws but the joke of this my in-law is too much, my brothers.
one day, I was from my own travel of everyday in the city, when I reached home I found my in-law home, my brother had not yet returned.
as always, she started.
"then my darling husband what have you brought for me today?" I told her today I don't have anything wife, I will bring for you a big gift and she said don't worry my husband today I have a big gift for you, and I knew it was a joke!
Mister left me in the sitting room and enter his room and I also did not stay, I left for my room immediately, I heard my in-law calling me, come here and already I had left and she said come here to my room, I reached but stood by the door, she said come in in-law.
heehh! I found her wearing a surprisingly very short dress, she told me, wait I show you the things that I give to you brother, she started sitting in different stimulating styles on the bed, in truth I was unable to understand her, and I asked her, sister-in-law is this also a joke or you are serious.
she looked in my eyes and then she continued.
when I saw that, I opened the door and left.
she called me in anger, I went back to my room and slept.
now I am even ashamed to look at my in-law.
is this correct stakeholder!
