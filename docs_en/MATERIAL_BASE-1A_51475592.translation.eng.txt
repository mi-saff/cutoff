players be good role models in the society
a good mirror of our community, they should not look at the great value they have.
we would love to see our players valuing and respecting themselves together with avoiding things that can destroy their reputations.
same to leaders or other famous people in the country, players are role models, because young children that are growing look at them and desire to be them when they grow up.
the players should know that when they become popular and recognized by the society they get the power and ability to encourage certain behaviors or certain decisions.
some people in the society can copy him for good or even bad things.
a good example is David Beckham of England who there was a time he launched a new hairstyle that many people not only in Kenya, even other countries copied his hairstyle.
several times we have seen the upcoming players imitate dressing styles, shaving and plaiting of their hair from their famous fellows.
those things that players do even just name, people can imitate especially our growing children and those that love games more.
even so it is open that players can cause big changes in our society either to be positive or negative.
therefore, our players when used well as ambassadors of different activities they will encourage positive changes in the society.
a player can start a productive projects from his earning.
these projects must not be concerning sports, he can open a school, start a music company or manufacturing of products.
it is true that sports is entertainment but also part of employment just like there are other types.
the truth is that entertainment does make players
