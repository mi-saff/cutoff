The call for President Duterte.
Bira Masukat, November 4, 2016, we believe that the campaign against illegal drugs by our President Rodrigo Duterte together with the Philippine National Police (PNP) and even the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) is being harvested.
In fact, the support in the campaign against illegal drugs by the Duterte government is really strong because even a few private sector and non-government units (BSP) have also made up.
But despite this success of the Duterte administration in the campaign against illegal drugs, it is covered with the intensified campaign against illegal drugs due to the intensified campaign against illegal drugs because it is as if the government is not able to pay attention on the war against illegal drugs.
Just like a call on Facebook, Luz Sarmiento and Lerio Bompat, Zambales.
Here is the entirety of the netizens, Miss Luz.
"Hey, it is guaranteed that for the president to not use drugs, focus on a hold-up and one of those close to our family were killed by a hold-up and one near our family, the teachers, who were killed.
Even if that is the widespread in our country, because no matter what you do, it will not stop that the hold-up will not stop, and if the police are going to take care of the people, we should just take care of the people.
This is only one of the many questions that we know, to be watched in social media everyday that hopefully the president and the PNP are pitiful because the victims of criminals who are taking advantage of the problem of the government against illegal drugs are pitiful.
