he searched a job for me and now am his sex slave.
hi guys, how are you?
it's two months now since I left working in the old company, and now I'm in another company, I was given this new job by my Boss who is the head of our department, I have gotten a promotion a bit, there I was a clerk and here I am supervisor.
now this Boss dropped me at work we have been friends since I entered here, what hurts me it's the behavior of this Boss of mine, I mean I have been like a slave, all the time he wants us to have sex, in the evening when it's time to leave he wants us to remain in his office, I found myself reaching home at nine so finding my mister already back in time, it becomes a quarrel, I have to fool him because the new job has become too demanding in me, I'm late to leave.
weekends it's like that, I have to fool them home that we are needed to work even on Sunday, I find myself living like a slave because of these work that I was given by this Boss, am worried that this words might my Mister it will become a problem.
I wish to go back to my earlier job, this new job pays me a good salary but I'm like a slave, sometimes when I show symptoms of insistence to remain in the evening he becomes harsh and starts to threaten me that "you forget who put you there" I am forced to be intimate with him although I don't like.
I'm asking for advice what should I do?
