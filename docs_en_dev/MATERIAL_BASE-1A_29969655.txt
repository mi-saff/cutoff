"Action can be taken against early marriages.

It has been written by Jacqueline Mrisho, Mawinza.

I was heard of 12th October, 2016.

The District Commissioner of Kilombero in Morogoro Province, James Mbatia has ordered the directors to take action against the executives in order to have early marriages in their areas.

Those directors who are supposed to be done is to be taken to the villages, streets and ward as a way to eradicate that problem.
The order has been issued by the head of that district, when he was reading a speech during the commemoration of the Girl Child Day which was organized by the Plan International Organization and held in Ihenga town.
Also, he has requested the police force and the executive director to make sure that all those who sell or pay girls under the age of 18 years have been arrested and arraigned in court.
