TV which are in Kenya and Uganda have bias against Lowassa's ovum?

I don't look through short news reports from Kenya and Uganda.

Centers like WS, NTV, including TV, K24, collecting a few days during their international news report without showing him Lowassa with his campaigns.

Question is a question.

1 - why do not fight against Magufuli and his CCM?

2 - the photos of the video they take place on YouTube or their colleagues are at Old Trafford at the convoy of President Lowassa?

3 - what is the goal, especially for giving excuses that one person and not all?

4 - this means that Magufuli has no international honor even here in A and east?

5 - even though my wife (CCM) usually told me that Kenya and Uganda will not want him to vote, those are not happy and it is not correct?
