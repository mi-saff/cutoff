There is a raid in Rice Humalig) and illegal gambling in Batangas.

CIDG raided the storage room that they had rice cakes, Amen, because at last, the PNoy administration woke up with what is happening like this.
And what he did was to be a raid, which led to all news because it led to DILG Secretary Mar Roxas and Secretary Mar Roxas and Secretary Francis "Kiko" Pangilinan, there is a lot of armed forces that came from the rice stored in the storage.
In one of the foolishness, they are calling the sack "scheme, which is being transferred to other sack to make it look like a good kind of rice.
It is said that the rice and other good types of rice will be collected, like in the market, we can buy the buyers, delicious food that we bought but the truth, we are eaten by NFA rice.
But the most bad thing done by the warehouse owner or rice scheme, we have seen the dirty and damaged rice that we saw in the TV Patrol, what we saw in the cleaning are being sold at the cleaning and being sold in the cleaning.
If you think about it, the value of rice is cheap, but because of the rice scheme, there is a lot of rice grains, which is why the price hike of rice is cheaper.
We are very well, this is in the upcoming SONA of PNoy, hopefully these killings will not be fulfilled.
Hopefully the Aquino administration will be true.
