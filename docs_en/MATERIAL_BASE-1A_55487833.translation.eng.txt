some of government officials in the Nakuru County have been accused of selling relief food which was required to benefit the poor.
speaking in Nakuru, Njoro Member of Parliament Joseph Kiuna said the government had already provided relief food but some corrupt leaders benefited from selling the food.
"government officials have the responsibility to defend and serve the people, but it is embarrassing that they are benefiting from the help of the poor," Mister Kiuna said.
the area has been affected by Maize Lethal Necrosis Disease (MLND) maize disease which resulted in poor crop yields.
the most affected areas are Njoro where the government continues to provide support to prevent hunger.
initially, some officials from the area demanded that the government establish a program of feeding pupils at school to prevent children from missing school.
Mister Kiuna challenged farmers to promote alternative food farming such as millet and potatoes to prevent hunger.
they are also encouraged to use different types of foods apart from maize to help children get better health.
"there are many schools in this area and their activities can be severely affected if the nutrition program will not start as students will be forced to walk around in search of food," he said.
the nutritional plan for school children is mentioned by researchers on education issues as one way to facilitate the largest number of children to receive education.
