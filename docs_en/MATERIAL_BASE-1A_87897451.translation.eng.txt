the member of parliament for Kuresoi South, Mister Zakayo Cheruiyot has asked the Majority Leader in Parliament Adan Duale to stop involving himself with the politics of that region and instead focus on national issues.
speaking in his constituency, Mister Cheruiyot expressed his anger on Mister Duale's speech when he visited the neighborhood constituency of Kuresoi North.
Mister Duale was quoted saying that he and his group led by deputy president William Ruto would continue to bring development in Kuresoi North constituency represented by Moses Eneo Cheboi (KANU).
in the statement, Mister Duale appeared to separate supporters of Bomet's governor Mister Isaac Rutto and the member of parliament for Kuresoi South as one of them saying they were friends of Raila Odinga and would want to undermine the Jubilee government.
"it's a great shame for leaders to come under the pretext of promoting development in the rural areas while aiming to harass and ridicule others."
said Mister Cheruiyot
Mister Cheruiyot ignored the statement saying already development was seen in his area and did not require Mister Duale and his group to come to him to bring about development.
