Desire for things or people.

Postigo also gave power.

It is desired to have a lot of things.
Apolinario is going to win.

Not all about the things or people like us, we are like a part of the fruits and vegetables, we also do not want to go back to others, but we are envious of what we have not want, but we are envious of those who have been jealous of them even if we are envious of someone who has been jealous of them, but we are envious of someone who has been jealous with others, and we are envious of others.

Even in the town where we were born, there are things that we do not want to go back to school, but because we don't want to go back to school, it's as if we do not want to go back to school, however, we do not want to go to church, however, we do not want to go to church anymore, however, we do not want to go to church anymore, however, we still do not want to go to church anymore, however, we are still young because it is hard for us to find a job now.

We should also treat each other as well, we don't want to lose his balance but because he can lessen the vices of drugs in the Philippines or even if there is a lot of his courage, these are the ones feared by the inhumane drivers of the rapist, DRU G people and other criminals.

While we are living on top of the world, we do not like it, 100 percent, and sometimes it is God who made all bad luck in our lives, and the question of course, "Mamondiong, a Lord?"

Who now is the reason why the Lord believes that the Lord is not fair in giving blessings,... that Duterte is blamed for the death of the drug pushers who were looking for the death of the drug pusher which is why they were able to buy a tape on the face and covered with bullets or with bullets.

So that there is no problem, avoid having a lot of things or people who are all full of things,... that if the illness will not be fully felt.
