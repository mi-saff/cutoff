The secretary of the Ministry of Health, Doctor Mpoki entertaining.
Not praising me, he said that the government is planning to increase the distribution of drugs in health centers, lets listen to the journalists last month after rumors emerged that lack of medicine and medical equipment.
It was always.
For now the real situation of drugs in Temeke, is equivalent to fifty percent and three percent.
That it is between one hundred and five hundred and five drugs that are required for instance, there is no drug abuse and one of those drugs and others are in the centers providing services.
The condition of the availability of drugs will improve more in October this year now.
And the sun is used to use a long-term contracts.
And I wouldn't want to be there.
In order to strengthen the availability of drugs.
Rise up according to the money they come.
Because I would have started.
That everyone has already received approximately twenty billion shillings.
Which is in ensuring that we are continuing to have these drugs like that I have spoken.
Now, that is the prime minister in the Ministry of Health, Doctor Mpoki Ulisubisya.
While speaking about that issue and how the government of President John Pombe Magufuli is continuing with him and last year a series of drugs in the country may be known as political tensions.
It was reported by various media stations in the country to end the provision of drugs that are important to the government institutions to reach out of ninety billion shillings.
The institution's spokesperson, but a resident magistrate of drugs in that country.
Holding that despite the complaints of lack of drug abuse or enough medicine, let me tell you now the lack of the hospital stations is going on time is caused.
Drugs are there in the hospital.
There is no drugs.
The medical camp there are drugs that were started to enter and are requested for.
How do you start a pipeline?
And will take the time to reach all hospitals and institutions.
The Fm's work.
For caring and distribution of breast cancer which we are spreading drugs due to the request that will enable them to distribute products without getting rid of his first motion which has brought in prayers.
Tarime, drugs are to be distributed and taken to those.
There has been a rumor that if one year recently, some of the ones that maybe they have.
It does not have that they were people who are supposed to pay those drugs, there is the fact that there is a fact that there is a fact that the rumors who was teaching is to ensure.
Every citizen can get treatment and that is why even you get out of those who had no drugs but they were given drugs for that, I cannot and take them.
It is continuing as usual these issues of paying debts have never happened when we are doing?
The value of the minerals due to them when they get who get money, say that they cannot get drugs, maybe it is just for a long time, but this issue will be resolved for recently, but there is no drugs to go to the concerned hospital because there is no drugs that died.
In the same time I don't know if it has been forced to give him a lesson to the beauties when it got to the time to take them.
There that hospital used to why it does not mean?
There are no drugs where maybe the government or not to help the hospital do not have money to bring in some drugs that can be given those drugs, maybe the situation is now.
In the picture if a hospital does not recognize drugs, it has continued to get money from the government and the local government hospital which has been viewed as a result of the drugs that happened in prison but also their income may be paid in prison but also their income can also increase wildlife in prison.
Some of the revenue that are together with the same way and there is a teaser?
He said the things like that they can increase the success when they see that they have more needs of drugs but the hospital like hospital and secondary schools has increased more than using money that they make.
Therefore, the money that their money get extra, from the other sources of revenue they can buy drugs.
We are continuing to give medicine and we gave medicine to find and announce that their account takes an amount of money.
That is why we say we are looking more to the citizen's health because the human health is not same as something or food or something that is why people have brought together you and that even your account does not have money or not that.
