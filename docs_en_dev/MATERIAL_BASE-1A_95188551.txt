In Zanzibar, it is not a foolish thing, even you are derived from BADEA, 2012.

Last week, the first Prime Minister (even in the picture), his position as the prime minister (Petroleum Bulk Procurement Agency, Alex Salomon Kalou, launched the campaign of the Scope Tanzania party (SCA) to encourage the voters' votes) of freedom of this country, which is expected to take place in future.
An issue of paying tax from England and England (because of what is called the United Republic of England, Hulk from Botswana which has been proud of for a long time and has got more strength after Salnero and Sussex at power in the year 2007.
Basically, the main policies of that politician and his party was to make sure that finally you are taxed from England.
When they came to power, Simeone has noted that they have a plan to do and listen to the opinion polls of paying taxes from the issue of launching it.
However, an obstacle is that they have been suffering from it since the beginning of the fact that together with different meanings in the country and there is difficult for the line that would be able to drive out taxes from the British.
We believe in approximately every field of life that make these people be more than different times.
And at the time I have organized this article, Salomon Kalou has got "bad news" from the opinion polls (they are known here in England, Peter Kwelukilwa.
According to Khajida Kopa, the votes of the opinion that was done by the church that will change this Friday, shows that it is only 33 percent of the infection of taxes they want to "freedom."
(19th), 57 percent are supposed to maintain taxes so that it continues to remain in the England.
The opinion polls of the opinion has warned Salomon Kalou, "he has a long mountain to climb" to change the ability of a lot of taxes from their country to relocate and England.
Likewise, he explained that there is lack of challenges that can contribute to taxes from many to oppose the idea of registering themselves, and gave them an example of issues like investors to get out of taxes (because it will enable them to use that machine, after launching it, England can start a step of cyber-shirts.
Meanwhile, Salomon Kalou has been informed that another fear that can threaten and burn in taxes and to support the idea of launching it is together with great cost of running a full country (especially during this period where the World's economy (Civil Society organizations).
Basically, in any exercise to vote, the state of lack of information or fear of "there is enough for many votes to remain with the party which is there or a result of a certain issue.
This means is being used by the ruling party (being together with CCM) in the elections where a message do not participate in elections where the delegation usually do so that "he does not succeed.
(Because of the party you should know is better than what you promised just without having examples of the leadership of the country.
However, Salomon Kalou has said that they are continuing with their efforts as they make faith that the great wealth is from taxes in the northern region (which will enable them to withstand the cost of running the country at the northern region, which will enable them to withstand the cost of running the country if not from taxes and the ones that will stop the idea of moving to England.
When it is happening here, you are supposed to collect taxes, at the end of the week at home there was bad news where the demonstrations to oppose the coalition in Zanzibar came into a huge violence.
If I have explained to my message on the article of Sauti Sol of their balances, that would be able to hear here if we shall be known here in Zanzibar, the violence in Zanzibar and the whole issue of unity is supposed to be dealt with.
Private, as the origin of the United Republic of Tanganyika and Zanzibar is its architects, that is the late father of the nation Mwalimu Julius Nyerere and Abeid Karume. I request it should be understood well.
The idea of the union was good because of various reasons, the biggest thing is the close relationship of the people of the mainland and the islands of Zanzibar.
But the problem that maybe been contributed by the political environment at that time, Nyerere and Karume explained that their consent was representing the consent of the people that are done by the people of Zanzibar.
There is a wisdom "one of the English that says," a good thing is not good for example, while giving a lot of food, a good thing is dangerous and that's why people are written, and that's why people are born and they do not have a long time due to a very long distances.
Now, the idea of the union was good but not getting the consent of many, where we are and where we are now and for a long time there have been struggling with the union, especially among the people of Zanzibar.
The main issue has been that they are being stolen, the people who are oppressed and others are going on well and claimed that the aim of the union was to make Zanzibar "by bad luck, politics of Zanzibar have different meanings in some of the mainland.
In the islands, religion has a unique opportunity in politics and therefore, many times the political issues can also be able to carry the feelings of religious, an issue that without cyber-crimes can be able to gather huge conflicts.
I would like to insisted that together with the danger that can come out in mixing religion and politics, experience and history have shown that lack of wisdom and interests of the community get in front of private feelings, religion can not be effects on politics.
In America, for example, religion still has a unique opportunity and maybe a good example of how many can't affect politics is Germany where the Democratic Republic of Mount Kilimanjaro is the biggest political party in that nation rich.
Likewise, the party that engages in Turkey, Tanzania and Development Party, is the Islamic party, even so, the party has succeeded to make Turkey to continue to be a nation that does not pollute the politics that are led by religion.
Even here in England, queen who is the head of the country (of more honor) is also the head of honor (TELC), but in Christianity, it is like a nation of the nation "but this country is run in law of" microcephaly "and not religious.
However, the religious problem is true that despite touching the private feelings of a believer, religious issues do not do a foolish thing (or not pictured).
Different from religion, politics is an issue of more ideology than faith (although faith in ideology can make sure the followers of the party do not see the importance like religion, though politics is focused on more on the current issues or not from here in the world.
Heavy rains are coming, while a believer in religion when he started believing that when he gets a union, for example, he is difficult to control someone from this kind because even his activities can endanger his life, or even he believes that he will be dealt with by his creator.
Basically the violence that happened in Zanzibar have been contributed by our politicians who at a large extent, they have been looking for what is was known as "fear from the chairpersons of the United Republic as the union being unable to inform us that they are unable to inform us that they are unable to inform us because they are unable to inform us about it.
We have been with the commission of coalition nuisances for many years, but its success has been depending on more than the reality.
We stop hypocrisy, "noise, so as to claim the change of the structure of the union (and even those funds should be emphasized) it can be taken against them or be the" national commission "to address those problems without getting solutions.
But there's another one to sucks in the rankings with the arrest of joy against their colleagues on the excuse of politicians who have dared to claim it's only a series of accusations of such kind, because there were only a series of accusations of that type, since there was also a series of accusations of that type, since there they had been accused that they were involved in AIDS in the islands.
Because up to this time I have organized this article still in the islands of Zanzibar, I request that I conclude by giving the importance of having the opinion polls that will enable them to compensate the offense that was done in the past to look for the consent of the citizens about the union.
If the opinion polls will decide to have three governments, then it should be remembered.
If you will not been decided and you are not satisfied, then it should be so (by the Ambassador Seif) of the United Republic of Tanzania?
At the end of, when I urged our leaders to speed up the opinion polls, which believe it will help to bring permanent solutions to all the problems of our union, it is very important for all the two governments (the United Republic of Zanzibar) to take a stern action against the terrorists who lost the coalition.
They make these criminals not to look for a goalless draw but like the seedlings of religious marriages between Christians and Muslims.
God bless TANZANIA.
