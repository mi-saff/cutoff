Finalizing the youth of Mbeya City.

The Vodacom Premier League, Mbeya City, the team that has received her popularity of its kind in this league, being the third position behind Azam FC and Yanga from all of Dar es Salaam.

It is clear that this league has had a unique challenge to new teams especially in Mbeya City which apart from being new in this league but it has brought a lot of great joy from the team, many of them were involved in especially for political fanaticism.

The history of soccer in Mbeya Region cannot be completed without stopping the teams that have ever done well in that league in the country such as Tukuyu Stars, Tigo Company and both teams in different times they were in that league and to give the ones for the soccer game in Mbeya Region.

In this league season under Coach Juma Mwambusi Mbeya City has managed to investigate and waiting for the old team in that league and showing a way of hope to do well in this league as it was for their brother to Tukuyu, which for the first time got the bridge on 6th February and this year to take a cup.

It was a history of being signed with a new soccer club in the country for the year 6 months whereby under the sponsorship of Tukuyu Stars which was popular by the nickname 'Hello', "caused the bridge to win the championship and to show a surprise of the teams in the provinces to relocate the health of Dar es Salaam.
In order to put well the soccer history in Mbeya Region, it is good to inherit the Mbeya Stars squad which was forced to play in Mbeya City in the African Champions League with a tough team from AFC Academy of Kampala which previously was recognized by the name Abaitakapotoka.

The players witnessed the Tukuyu Stars squad under Coach Athuman Juma, who was the goalkeeper, Mbwana Makabe, the central defender Ali Dhanji, and Daniel Chundu, who represented the front of Godwin Mutahangarwa.

The defense of the defense of Yusuf Macho, the body of the attack, Richard Lumumba (the late) and Kevin Haule, Zekirer, Karima Mrisho and Suleiman Mwaniki.

After being seen well in that league the team stopped more registration for the previous year and added a vibrant players like the Christian and Asmara, Ali Mrisho Kikwete, Salum Kabona (the late), Michael Saro, Salum Moyoni.

In addition to that success, Tukuyu Stars had a lot of challenges of its players moving to the big team of Yanga and Simba, where that team has already witnessed its vibrant players such as women Godwin Samwel, Salum Kabinda, Steven Mussa and others following that team.

It should be remembered that Tukuyu Stars was a painful truth to the Yanga team which when the time was successful to rise in the premier league and took the team by 1-0 in Mbeya City and 2-1 in the repeat match in Dar es Salaam.

Following the history of Tukuyu Stars that occurred in the year 2008, under the current coach of Mbeya City, Juma Mwambusi, there are primary issues that are supposed to consider so as to ensure that it reaches the league of the premier league for many years to come and even win the championship.

In addition to the success that happened in Mbeya City in the league season that ended yesterday there are many weaknesses that are supposed to be worked on and put the team in the success of the league in the next season.

In a total of 26 matches it played in Mbeya City, has won 13 matches out of 10 matches out of 3 games, has been closed a total of 32 points and scored 21 goals and scored 49 points to be leading 3 points in the league standings.

Until it starts the first leg in that team as it was for the teams of this league of Azam, it has never lost only one game.

In the second round of that league, such a team that had already been redeemed by Yanga who played three matches, was defeated by Yanga which in the first round, was defeated by Coastal Union in Tanga City and later lost an important match to lead Azam at the Sokoine stadium.

There are many that emerged out in the match including rumors that emerged even before the match that Mbeya City has changed the match and that the situation is a must for Azam FC to win that match and ensure the championship before the completion of that league.

If it was seen on 30th June, the beginning of Mbeya City entered into the field and seen playing under the level with his attackers unable to fight against Azam and caused them to the whole period of the ball to be played at the stadium.

Its a few times the players of Mbeya City were seen near the Azam's goal, a situation that some of the fans started to be afraid that maybe that team can be defeated by Azam where one minutes before going to a half time before going to his team.

The second half started by getting rid of Mbeya City team, instructions of those teachers started to show the hopes of the team to restore the hope of the fans and finally the 70 minutes, Mbeya City player Mwaura who succeeded to draw the goal through the mud.

The expectations of doing well in that squad started to get into the mistakes of the referee in the match between Azam and Kilimanjaro, who was sentenced to the Azam team being assisted by Godfrey Kihesa, all from Arusha City.

The results of the game that cause violence to fans even some of the players were seen in the referee, even so there is a lot of things to learn in that team due to the whole exercise of that league and how it occurred.

There are blame from one of the one where Mbeya City is not supposed to discover that after seeing it has started getting popularity, playing under the level and gave Azam to win and win the cup before the end of the league.

Mbeya City has not completed the record that was put by their brother to Tukuyu Stars, it should be looking for alternative strategies to strengthen the squad by honor to the efforts of the soccer stakeholders of Mbeya Region and elsewhere, who in one way or another were when a team's success is a situation.

As a sports stakeholder and sports journalist, I will not leave this so that it can be the catalyst to the development of this club which apart from bringing economic opportunities to the residents of that city where apart from the entry opportunities to the residents of the city where apart from the entry fees on the neighborhood, many visitors from neighboring provinces comes to cheer their team.

Mbeya City is required to learn from his predecessor who until now seems to be aired on this league, it should be remembered for a long-term team played in the year 2011 when the coach who is currently the coach of Mbeya City, Juma Mwambusi.

Until now it is still ongoing in a machine for every season because it survives the bridge during this season with a total of 28 points with a total of 25 points, having a total of 25 points and lost 10 matches and lost 10 matches.

The Mbeya City team is owned by the City Council of Mbeya where has risen up in this league season.

The Mbeya City squad was led by coach Juma Mwambusi and the players David Bro / Geoffrey Julius, Hassan Mwasumilwe, Elias Kiyemba, Yusuf Macho, Francis Khibhisa and Jeremiah John.
