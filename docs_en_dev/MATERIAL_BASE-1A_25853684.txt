Stakeholders in the cotton sector gathered in order for together they should come with the answers of the challenges facing the sector.
It is in the conference that took place in Dar es Salaam, including the heads of provincial heads of farmers of cotton the traders and sponsors of various agricultural programs.
Approximately twenty years ago the agricultural sector to use it as one of the big revenue sources to the residents of Lake Region and other areas in the country.
Small-scale farmers are accused of agriculture as a better plan in their daily lives.
We were this week to go hand in hand with the start of industries for energy production and different products that come from.
It is estimated more than one million and five hundred thousand people out of one year out of nine that were affected by two, color, system of clothes and fuel from the cotton.
During one thousand, nine hundred and the cotton program entered into the main market for the hopes of improving more in the whole issue of production.
The cotton industries started to witness the conflicts that are being caused by politics and the tension between the party and the police in general.
According to the agricultural law of the contract, the ability is operated by desire to pass through a veteran artist tobacco only, even so farming for a contract affects the life and it was surrounded by the first.
At the periphery of the stakeholders of the agricultural sector of the cotton sector that took place in Dar es Salaam, the minister of agriculture, food and security in the United Republic of European Union from Christopher Chidawali about the farming system.
I have said agriculture for a contract like agriculture for the contract is not bad.
We have given you know that you have already introduced my talks when she was caught in my talks when she was full of events, I was speaking.
That we are starting the agriculture of a contract, there are things that we know it will be based on time in the middle of the head of the person between the group.
Ahmed.
She has gone down.
The biggest journey here is what is needed is that all do not understand what I hope.
The contracts is a must in the language that two people feel extremely tired and that I will be found.
It is nothing.
This is a strong man I have gotten a lot or partner with Mister I got a end of the day I will take this day (which is legal?
What is looking at the system themselves?
Because you can be aired by farmers to get subsidized inputs, what do you need.
Separate yourself in my way that I believe is.
It is to look at what things that are in the agricultural sector that have not been happy with the farmers to be welcoming them more than saying when the contract comes from when he was.
We've done well we will enable farmers to get loans.
One of the chest with others that offer them.
They give loans to the ones that we want to get their money they were given now there is a challenge.
It is said that the small industries sector in the country has the ability to decide the cotton farmers in a problem of poverty if the government in collaboration with other stakeholders will be able to help the agricultural sector of solving the challenges facing the agriculture.
The first picture is not that she was just before doing trials for three years.
Those who is spreading and that is the meaning.
The stakeholders will decide you to agree on ten o'clock and one that it doesn't know the country.
The late does the problem here on its implementation, there are some of the first stakeholders to have different goals and others who don't have integrity, but agriculture for the contract is the only way that will be able to prevent the name and names of the ones with industries that do not lie!
If he will be found and both buyers will get after buying so that they do not do milk and eventually be able to sell and also the District Council will also get taxes like the tax collection.
If you ask your agreement on my opinion, is the only way to supervise well and I found it to save.
We have managed to have a great reason for the first reason we have begun to take care of groups and so we are told every house in the group should look for my husband's husband and to be given.
After paying two hundred thousand money.
To me, if it is informed, he says.
But you can't jump, he has refused to make you better in different wards in every village, we have taken our village, which is sure every time will be affected by each other.
Since the end of the day.
They are inspiring.
What they know their history in the last day are good people who have increased even while complaining that when the last day they are ready to come and say when we got a long time because it has a company that we want them to enter the market early this year.
They have forgotten your opinion, you will go to another place.
If the way you will help the citizens to take money and be able to sell the money so that you can be able to sell our minerals because I see the customer and the fate of debts that they have been put in a great success to farmers because if you remember they have begun to see fruits in the increase.
Production of cotton for one acre of year up to last year is taking care of the Swahili language on February last year contrary to the third time so that we can be used in accordance with the government then they finished Western Town.
Within four coming down of one acre.
Therefore, it is not good.
It is broken even without stopping.
We went to according to the state of farms there are many benefit.
The family of this child is the sacred percentage of switching off their seven million dollars.
Which everyone can be used to produce.
What happens from five hundred thousand until now.
Basically we have seen, so much and palaces, many youths have been looking at a price that it's not good to use then produce and put it even if it will make sure that you will be about us because of them, it should remember what?
If you get an inexhauste our names, our names are out and I have been receiving a good example among our youth, what we have witnessed youths whom we have witnessed, what we have witnessed.
My hairstyles for Singida is expecting to be sold to the youth who is supposed to be sold to that team and also to talk about more than one acre of time, "the youth has touched me, I went to use me so that I have been very good because it's no peace that brings them bad incidences.
Also, also.
Transportation of farming has refused to refuse this is a very big problem, then there are people who depend on the motorcycle that you're getting in the same way and stop the farmers there are no thoughts and readers.
Because, I am pleased by you, you can't speak about the person that spread yourself in this time without knowing that they are found.
Because I hear you are in the last stage.
Therefore, we are trying so much to see the big problem is not that the farmers will not go down here to grow and also to know if you are doing so, and even this service we have done to see the firefighting efforts.
That it is easy for?
But why does it mean that the course is a foolish thing.
Here in us read the government at another time.
That is the problem.
Farming for a contract is good because it becomes a must for selling your crops and the price is in that time because I will continue to sell our cotton industries in the world market and we will not hesitate to sell our air, then we will start with him to buy and has its own benefits to the least.
He started while I was able to see for agriculture.
I was in the past we stopped the least of this contract we go and what is being bullied.
That is everything we need and.
First, it was and I was a small farm after getting into the farming period after being sworn in everything.
Those have been done when you reached in the past, but in the past it was a must to continue depending with the ability of the contract with my fellow farmers since agriculture of the contract had a lot of education through our sponsors who are going on.
That is that until now, the farmers were mentioned so much the agriculture of the contract is like other than the meaning that it was sent every person gets benefits by using's security.
Pests who are also one of the challenges in the agricultural sector of cotton, different ways are used as well for agriculture and control of lack of deaths in number now.
And then?
