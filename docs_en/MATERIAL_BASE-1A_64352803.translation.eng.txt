it is the children and the brother of the leaders of CCM only who remained to fight for life and death
I have been following the trends of the political leaders of CCM with their children together with their other people who are genetically close and to witness that when you leave the leaders on their own of CCM, the second group does anything possible to try and rescue that party is for the children of those leaders.
a lot of children of the leaders of CCM, mainly on WhatsApp groups and Social media are fighting life and death to save their parents' sustenance.
their main game that they are using is to show the public that the opposition is not worthy by, "Lowassa is corrupt person"
a lot of them have no understanding, they have very little capability of reasoning which is associated with being confused and the arguments they create during the confrontations are very surprising.
you will not believe the answers, the competition and their arguments when you meet with them and try to explain that where we have reached there is need for change!
their argument has a lot of anger and symbolizes that they are entitled to the destiny of Tanzania.
