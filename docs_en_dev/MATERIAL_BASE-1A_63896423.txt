Records for the Emirates.
Wednesday on the 26th of March, 2008 I went to view a match between Baamar and Sweden at the northern region of London.

I have arrived at Emirates. Inside the match, there are more eyes on the pitch and every famous player like Frederick Lungamano (Sweden) or Robinson (Bungado), touched me a lot of noise, followed up and I think the goal came in.
When I went to this big balls, they do not make up a few minutes if even the ball themselves, if there is a big player from Argentina if I was seen, I did not hesitate to see a good player like the same day, maybe Zinedine Zidane, had never seen, but I had decided to see him, the fans of Brazil did not want him.

Then the day before yesterday at the Arsenal stadium, what is usually happy is the same as they play during the World Cup Tournament which was played at the World Cup, Mexico, when he went to each other, it's going against him, then there is a lot of joy and another goal is against the noise from each other.
Going to a speech, it is to attend Karume Stadium, meeting with your fellow human beings, screamed, and eat with each other, and when you see the strength and the ones for life, the stadium had never seen the forest that was surrounded by a pest.
In the past, the ball was said to be at the junction of work (especially in Europe) singing with bad luck they were given to bad luck, on these days the issues have been changed and they are people who have the women that deal with the youth.
Brazil scored 1-0 goals but for me it is not important for the importance of being in a bad state, happy and exciting.
