Beware of food in brook at and cakes in PDEA.

The warning of the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency is very worrisome against those being thrown at the streets, particularly outside public schools, not only in Metro Manila but also in the whole country.
PDEA Director General Undersecretary Jose Gutierrez himself, Jr. warned the public to avoid the buying of the homeowners who are being sold on the streets, even in receiving gift cakes and brook, from an unknown person.
Gutierrez admits that these kinds of food will be cheaper if they are outside, but you are not sure what the ingredients are placed in them.
The warning was made by PDEA after a positive leaf of marijuana was eaten by 17 employees of the Provincial Hospital of San Marcelino, Zambales.
According to PDEA, last week, a nurse received three boxes of the gift that was owned by brows as a gift to his birthday and the said brotherhood in the said hospital.
After eating, the health workers felt the diets and abuse of the body which is why they were immediately given first aid.
They were able to put these kinds of brook, and when the results came out, it was discovered that there was a positive movement of dried marijuana leaves as one of the ingredients in making brows.
PDEA is very alarmed, which is why they immediately released a warning to the public to avoid that kind of incident.
According to PDEA-PIO chief Director Derrick Carreon, whoever will eat this kind of food with dried marijuana or marijuana will possibly become addicts.
It is said that marijuana would be what we want to be drug, and despite being used by it, it is possible to find a stronger kind of drugs.
Gutierrez tried to convince his personnel to determine who is the responsible for it and where the factory of the said food came.
This warning of PDEA should not just ignore especially the parents who have students in public schools where there is widespread selling of food outside.
