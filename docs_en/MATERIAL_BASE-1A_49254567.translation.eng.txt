October 21, 2016
delegates from the countries neighboring Libya gathered on 19th October in Niamey town so as to try to continue with the file on the crisis in Libya.
those involved in the lack of peace who are Niger, Chad, Tunisia, Algeria, Sudan and Egypt have insisted that the conflicting sides should hold negotiations that will involve all stakeholders.
more than five years after foreign countries getting involved in Libya, the situation in the country is still complex.
"today we are witnessing many incidents in the country of Libya and that's the reason that will be needed to have a meeting with all the stakeholders in order to look for a solution," said the Chadian Minister for Foreign Affairs.
in one statement, six neighboring countries that met in Niamey town showed their support for Libya that is faced with conflict.
neighboring countries also feel involved with lack of peace and to therefore called on both conflicting parties to sit at a negotiating table that will involve all stakeholders.
"there is no point for foreign countries to get involved in the issues of Libya, there is no military solution.
we request the government to have unity in order to reach those who do not take part in that government," said Pierre Buyoya, a representative of the African commission.
peace in Libya is for the sake of its residents but also its neighbors, said Martin Kobler, the special representative of the United Nations.
"it is true for all stakeholders to accept the advice of the international community, but they are supposed to do that themselves. we cannot decide on their behalf," added Kobler.
