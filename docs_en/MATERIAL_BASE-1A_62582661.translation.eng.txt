maybe I -- I should return to the same place to get rid of our doubt and particularly my dear Star T_V viewer -- I am defending him can you try to get him to get rid of doubts when we're talking about the matter of ethics we have talked about the issue of transparency here and in it is the issue of honesty in the very same values but there is also the issue of right in values before we go into these taboos how have you brought it for this person to get the truth of the matter and gets his right and he can truly see that I have personally placed this leader and I can remove him anytime when I say get off sir and he gets off according to the procedures of the constitution (()) -- you know -- have you understood my question ?
I have understood because when you talk about the issue of transparency it relates so much with when a leader is chosen as a public leader he is first supposed to declare publicly -- yes -- for example to publicly declare the property he has in that period (()) after being elected .
to declare the wealth he has the wealth they -- what his wife has or the children who have not attained eighteen years because if they are eighteen then that means that one is independent .
therefore this transparency is by law but it is transparency that involves any public leader so that we know his interests do not conflict public interests like for example I am in an office I -- maybe there is a tender that is supposed to be -- to be announced .
but the tender has -- has been announced and whoever comes to get it is my wife .
that is why I say that do not confuse yourself -- your wife your husband -- your wife (()) my husband because of my husband meaning I was talking to you in general that that tender instead of -- that is I have announced the tender in my office but whoever gets the tender is my own husband .
so and -- that is why I say personal interest should not be confused with public interest meaning they should not conflict -- the interests in your personal home should not conflict public interest .
therefore transparency must be there and if -- for example this issue you are talking about the issue of contracts which also in some phase earlier we talked about the issue about the contracts .
that also is transparency that we want to ensure that what happens the citizens involved and benefit from this matter should be knowing what is going on they should make a decision about it and that transparency results from that -- from that (()) .
