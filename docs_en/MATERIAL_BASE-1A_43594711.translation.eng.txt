the other day were launched 16 days against gender violence in the world that began on November 25 to December 10 this year.
the annual event aims to have a collective force in preventing the spread of the violence in the country in five regions by providing education and mobilizing public protest against gender violence and promoting the importance of safety education for all.
it is clear that this year those days are celebrated when the Ilala Police officials from the Ilala Police Station, Christina Onyango, say that the celebration has helped to increase community awareness, a step that has helped to receive more rape cases compared to previous years.
he said last year Ilala received 216 rape cases and among the cases, 25 were convicted for lack of evidence, but this year 226 cases were received and 112 were convicted.
so it is best for women in various areas to emerge in areas of the celebration in those days with a view to combating such violence and various training.
during those days many women are required to come out to get education, they will also meet and see how to deal with the various challenges that arise during struggle against gender violence.
but keeping quiet and closing your eyes on acts of violence is not a good thing, what is required is women coming out to provide sufficient evidence to combat gender violence in society especially women who are the greatest victims.
these 16 days should not be lost but be used as a guideline for society and ultimately they will help fight against the actions that are motivated by various factors in society.
