additionally some of the citizens have claimed that the budget hasn't aimed to free the citizen because it has set aside only thirty percent for the purpose of development projects while the other seventy percent has been set side for the purpose of normal expenditures of the government .
the budget made me happy because you must built your house according to the ability you have and the best thing is that the honorable minister has explained fully which areas he wants to give a priority to .
and I being a person in investment -- I am thankful that he has prioritized the issue of investment because they are the ones who will be paying tax .
we can produce -- we are together with very many tax payers that before putting restrictions there are harvests which are in the provinces which are unable to -- to be spread and its results is that the price where they are produced is very little and the price becomes very expensive where they would be expected to reach .
so now what results due to its results ?
the infrastructure isn't good .
on my side I feel it will hurt us the low level people very much due to the reason that they have given a priority to things that do not help us citizens and leaving the low level people sinking .
