Malinzi, who are going for Lowassa to do?
December 23, 2014.

President of the Tanzania Football Federation (TFF), Jamal Malinzi, has all the rights of having a friendship with someone and support him in any matter with someone and to support him in any matter with a happy, so that the project did not meet anyone who wants to meet or talk to anyone.

But there is a big difference, very big between Jamal Malinzi, as a private person, Jamal Malinzi as the president of TFF.

I will give a few examples only, Jamal Malinzi can go to the field and play a goal when Yanga team is playing.

If someone personally, Malinzi can go to a campaign meeting while wearing a red card of the club that he loves but as the TFF president, there is a level that he cannot cross in showing his love.

Every time he works, is supposed to put first the interests of his first institution before his personal interests, when it got to the time to choose out of a matter with its benefits and the benefit of TFF, the TFF president is supposed to choose the one with profit to the institution.

It is a lot of small things but the great effects are very big and that is why they were announced and his action of visiting the retired prime minister the day before yesterday and got him about strategies of the federation he is leading.

A big question that is being asked here is because we failed to explain the plans and plans of TFF to Lowassa.

Lowassa is not the minister of the ministry of information and sports which to be working closely with that federation as Lowassa as the minister of that ministry, I would be able to understand the aim of Malinzi to go.

By bad luck, I have not heard of Malinzi has went to the minister of that ministry, Doctor Fenela Mukangara, and to tell him about the strategies that he has explained when Lowassa went to the person who TFF did not do with him directly?

I would like to tell ourselves as Lowassa as the chairman of the Parliamentary Committee on Social Development which is involved with sports issues, but Lowassa is the chairperson of the Parliamentary Committee on foreign affairs which is true that it does not have one relationship with TFF.

If Lowassa was the member of the National Sports Council (BMT) I would be able to understand the goal of Malinzi, but by bad luck, Lowassa has never been a member of the council.

I say openly that I could also understand if Malinzi has gone to meet President Jakaya Kikwete, because his government is the value of the income by the coach of the National Team (Taifa Stars), but Lowassa is a member of parliament and he is not in government at the moment.

If Malinzi had a problem of talking with the retired prime minister, he is known to love soccer "is called Frederick Sumaye and not Edward Lowassa, when I met with Sumaye and told him about his plans to improve soccer, on how he could not understand.

That is why I asked himself, Malinzi followed what to Lowassa?

Edward Ngoyai Lowassa that I would like to know I have never seen him in any big soccer match in the country for a long time now, basically, when you talk about the names of politicians who love the soccer game, the name Lowassa does not expect it.

We thank all politicians who come at the National Stadium during a big and small football match, Professor Juma Kapuya, usually arrived at the field of Samuel Sitta not to come up at the field, but also one of the sponsors of Simba Club, I have also met them on the field, but just many times, Freeman Mbowe and Zitto Kabwe.

Amos Makalla continued to come up at the field of Mussa Azan, who attended the match, Richard Kasesela, who attended the match. Juma Nantulya in a match where I have seen him often in Mwigulu Nchemba who attended the match at the National Stadium where there is a big match to be played.

I don't know if Lowassa has got into that stadium to view one match in soccer and it's very important for my rights to say that Lowassa is not someone with the ball and it's not something to follow up and to hold the top position in this country, everyone knows that Kikwete likes the club of Yanga.

On soccer fanaticism, there is no secret.
