Last week, the Law and Human Rights Center (LHRC), organized a forum for the purpose of discussing about the existence of death of death in the country wants to be demolished and it can be used for the claims that it is against the human rights as the constitution has explained the existence for a right to live.

In that conference that brought together various stakeholders for the purpose of discussing and giving their thoughts about the presence of that punishment in the country and the importance of the country, LHRC, says, the right to live is the very basic right of death is an correct example of the violation of the rights of living.
Speaking at the conference, that was part of the commemorations to oppose that punishment, the Director of LHRC, Doctor Hellen Kijo Bisimba, says the right to live with the constitutional process under article 14 of the constitution of the United Republic of Tanzania of the year 1977, even so the security and the constitution is not correct.
The punishment for the death in the country can't affect any person that was found guilty of treason under the murder cases and 197 of the law on legal regulations and so as to be implemented by that punishment is until President Magufuli had signed the certificate of implementation of the punishment given by the court.
The constitution is requesting the security of the right to live under article 14 but it has also emerged the security against human resource that were affected by article 13 (6) (5).
In addition, that station is saying that the punishment caused by the Constitution of the country by fighting with article 14 that gives a broad range of death, but it is 20 years where that punishment is not implemented here in the country.
Apart from that LHRC, it is giving reasons for wanting that punishment to get to the country, to reach at the end of the national debate about its presence and implementation of that punishment to ensure that all sides can be taught.
I am saying that because in the forum that was organized by LHRC, there are two sides that agreed to continue the existence of that punishment, as they see more that even in the religious books they produce an opportunity to be implemented with that punishment for everyone who is faced with the offense of that type.
For example, the Islam religion are explaining that some of the articles that are there in the great book of the Quran, the death is the right to manslaughter, his rights and not allowed me is not the same.
Furthermore, the other side explained that to continue implementing the law and when the punishment for death came out, there are their responsibility to ensure it is implemented.
It is because of the presence of those condition, having the importance of having a national debate which you will be able to ensure that you finish the issue of death of death and every part you will enable the members to come out in community, there are people who are doing major events to that the punishment is legal.
It is on that logic, to reach when various public institutions use to use their time by educating the community to avoid mistakes which in one way can help them to reach the place of meeting with that punishment for death.
