the government has emphasized that it won't hesitate to take action against militia police officers who will be found taking part in oppressive actions on feeder women and other business people, expressed that such actions are contrary to the law.
moreover, it has advised business people to do their activities in the officially designated areas by the committee in order to avoid friction with the concerned authorities.
the minister for the state, in the office of the president (Tamisemi), Selemani Jafo, has given that position in parliament today in Dodoma when he was answering a question from the special seat parliamentarian, Zianab Vullu (CCM), who wanted to know the government's strategies to prepare a good business environment for feeding mothers to protect them from harassment by militia police in all towns in the country.
in her question, she said that more than 30 per cent of the urban residents get their breakfast, lunch and even supper from these feeding mothers, but these important service providers find themselves harassed every day.
Jafo said that the government recognizes and values the great contribution from small scale business people who are in this informal sector in growing income and creating employment.
in regard to this importance, all authorities have been directed to ensure they set aside areas for these small scale business people, including feeding mothers, close to where the customers are.
speaking about militia oppression, he said whatever they are doing is contrary to the 1969's law of assistant police that bars them from beating up, taking or destroying citizen's items or property.
he insisted that militia police, as it is to other public servants, are supposed to follow the law, principles and procedures without oppression or abuse whenever they are removing business people from places they are not allowed to operate from.
