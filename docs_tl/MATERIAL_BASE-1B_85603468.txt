Binoe will go to Bato By Betchai HSeptember 2, 20169.
PNP Chief Director General Ronald "Bato" dela Rosa asked the appeal of actor Robin Padilla to President Rodrigo Duterte not to name the actors using illegal drugs.
In dela Rosa's statement, this does not agree to follow Padilla as a sign that the government's campaign against illegal drugs will not be fair.
The PNP Chief explained that if the PNP's request is to choose, it is as if the PNP's request is to make the identity of the actors involved in illegal drugs, hence, dela Rosa insisted that they are holding the list of actors using and involved in illegal drugs so it is appropriate to name them.
