Soccer is a game with many fans, especially the youth of different ages.

It is an indication that the soccer game has had many most fans in the whole world including the fans of Tanzania who are ready for anything including he had gone down from money because of it to go to the game.
There is no sin to love sports, but there is a need to put boundaries between support sports and to do the work of bringing development or to improve economically. Because of these fanaticism they have been ready to use all the money they are facing so that the project is only.
If this issue of my issue will be able to speak up until today I decided to speak about it, that is also seen to fall into the government which is capable of losing young people, whose some of them have decided to focus in playing practices, instead of him who are involved in using the funds they get in.
The Deputy Minister, Office of the Prime Minister who is in charge of labor, employment and youth, Antony Mavunde, recently explained his disappointment with the behavior of youths who use a lot of time to stop the results of sports and using a lot of money for a long time.
Mavunde, wants the youths not to get time gambling and instead they use that money to be satisfied with the results in development issues, I join and Mavunde, in that, it is not good not to understand the youths or people who do not understand themselves and get money gambling.
That is a person who is working again for being enough to buy a little income, that disease is using to play food and she does not have sure of getting, his results were coming from work, money has lost and he does not win until now.
Again others are following the danger or wanting to prove to their colleagues that they are already at the time when she gets into a problem, he does not know what is wrong!
The youth leave this things, do your development issues.
There is a place where you don't know your youth and even more people who were found to prevent and get married, when you see you are doing good things that do not have a meaning, up to you asking you like these family members and if they are already eating.
The whole father or a youth is getting home and then you are going to work, yet at work, they should go to get money because it's not good or knowledge, this life is not good to know, mental and knowledge, this life is not friendly and lost money.
You can say it is your work, your money and your decision, like it is okay and if you feel it does not have a person with your own problem, but if your life is possible to support your family, then you get money they want to sell your problems.
Deputy Minister Mizengo Pinda said me of me, I urge you to know, you must have goals in life, remember that refereed that match, they do business, themselves that they do, they are not true.
I have no objection and a person who does work and to get enough money for the purpose of going or to fulfill its private needs and of her family, then he does not have an additional money and then he is giving you a lot of money for the system then your condolences to you.
If you love you, look at work together with the aim of bringing up to our country to bring progress to you, and the community that surrounds them, at a end and at the end, the last time is not good.
