President John Magufuli has urged provincial and district heads to avoid bringing unnecessary conflicts in their councils, while ordering local governments to cooperate with those leaders to manage development finances.
Daktari Magufuli gave those orders at Musoma town Mara province the day before yesterday, in the speech, which was read on his behalf by the Minister of the Country, Office of the President Provincial Administration and Local Government (TAMISEMI), George Simbachawene when he was opening the 32nd General Meeting of the Local Administration Community (ALAT).
the President emphasized that provincial and District leaders are the executives of the National Government in their areas, therefore there is no reason for local government leaders to avoid involving them in bringing development to the citizens.
he said, the government will continue taking strong actions, executives who shall be identified to be misusing public funds and he wanted local government leaders to implement the promises they made to citizens during the last General Election.
initially, Vice chairperson of ALAT, Stephen Mhapa, congratulated the Fifth Term Government for providing free education and promised to support those efforts.
that Meeting continued yesterday.
