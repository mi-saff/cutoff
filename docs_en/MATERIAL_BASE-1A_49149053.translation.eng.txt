more than 56 million have been collected in a fundraising fund for the continues construction of patients' route at the hospital in Mbeya region.
the fundraising that was led by the Provincial Commissioner, Amos Makalla.
even though, together with getting that amount, there is still a challenge of collecting more funds because 110 million shillings was needed so as to finish that construction.
in that fundraising that was done by friends of that hospital, cash money 9.8 millions shillings was collected, therefore a total of 23.1 million shillings inclusive of 13 million shillings that was in the bank, that were contributed by the stakeholders before the fundraising day.
