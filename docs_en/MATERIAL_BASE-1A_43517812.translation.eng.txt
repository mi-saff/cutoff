although Sydney's parents are Tanzanians who were born in Hanang in Manyara Region, their son is an American citizen by birth and in August this year he will carry the flag of the United States at the Olympic Games in Brazil, competing in 5,000 meters race.
reason for being American citizen "my parents were studying the United States, where I was born on August 21, 1996 in the city of Riverside, California County, USA.
"my parents told me when I was two years old I was brought to Tanzania, I joined with my Hanang colleagues and shepherding calves according to our traditions.
"class one I started in Arusha, Swift Academy, but later I was taken back to California to get my rights of free education, health and sports opportunities," reports Sydney.
how does he feel not to carry Tanzania flag in the Olympics?
Sydney, a student at the Adam State University (ASU) located in Rockies hills of the state of Colorado on a special program of NCAA Scholarship Program says he ever asked for Tanzanian citizenship but has failed.
"I love Tanzania and that is why I am in the United States, wearing Tanzanian jazzy, bangles and colorful bibs with the Tanzanian flag, US allows for dual citizenship, but I cannot be a Tanzanian as my parents are due to the Constitution.
"I grew up in the United States but my origin is Tanzania, where my parents are, I wish Tanzania would allow dual citizenship for to go home and do great things for my country," says Sydney.
