The victims.

I do not know why I woke up last December 31 last month of the month and last day of the year 2016, after 12 years of year, 2017, 2017!
On the eve, when I finished this column, I don't know why my mind's order to write.
Because my mind is asking when there is an occasion at Christmas, New Year.
Bisayan is being given attention by those who are preparing for other occasions, happiness or grieve, in the preparation of the will - happiness or sadness, "the next day, you are busy.
Like the feast, the food will not be cooked for the visitors for the visitors, as well as Christmas and New Year in the birthday or grieve, the eve of everyone is true, "isn't it?
At the eve of the New Year, I have not prepared for the Noche Buena but a small piece of our family.
There are those who are ready to run away from Barangay Kalapati, beef, chicken, and sweet words. "
But what you feel is severe, what will I bring in my life, to our lives of the New Year after a Bisayan?
For me, it is a Bishops that determines hope and we want what will happen on the day that they are waiting for.
After Holy Week, the day is scheduled to be expected now?
Whether the visitors are not ready, the arrival of the visitors are happy, is they happy?
It's embarrassing, isn't it that you are extremely busy yourself on Christmas day just to make sure that all your small days are complete.
It is you who spent, tired, you and yourself are worried that your preparation is not right or lacking.
I ask for forgiveness from my letter, I don't know if it is right to your taste, after this, I let the water go down and have known the coffee.
Also thinking if the ingredients cooked for the New Year will be happy, my family will only be satisfied with what we have shared during the time of Bispears and day of joy!
