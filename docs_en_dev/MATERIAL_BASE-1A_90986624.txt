The long-fielder of Simba and Yanga when they met one when he changed why it is a must that you will be found to say anything, I would like to say one thing, I can say that there is politics.
The matches of us.
Tanzania is going on.
We believe that we are talking about today's match, we will speak Simba and Yanga here in the school which is a team that is building even the national team but politics is not yet known as the whole issue that every person is fanaticism.
We don't know since I get a certain player, if you get married, you go back to see you and I did not want to stop you and I did not speak about what is not pleased with any political parties.
I did not mean that it is not even those phones is peace.
There is no another thing.
The registration is taking place between Simba and Yanga if you check the players of Simba and Yanga once you were playing yesterday, the player was coming from Yanga who plays for Yanga who was playing Yanga but the problem was doing well.
That was called for him that you had a certain team, he has changed the ownership has come from.
There is no another thing in which he is talking since everything fans should speak about.
If a phone has a team speaking about those fans who go to the field who are twenty-two players looking at the team but if the team is a member of Simba and Simba we know that it is a shortage of Simba and Simba we know if they are responsible for a shortage or how Yanga has the strength.
We are fans.
But the teams that are ten thousand in the pitch and those are people who represent other people.
It is set aside for players.
Also, that you come up because if you look for example, if the appellant, Darcoboa, went against Tottenham going to check but what happened after him came back to make preparations so as to return.
That's true you cannot be able to do not to believe that he can do something with them but to use them and believe in this, there are some things that cause violence that caused the rice.
I have given you the condition of not just after saying me that I will be Simba I went to Simba I will play Yanga but there are players who if you check.
Other teams like you know the sim card they have good players more than they, but that one has the ability and faith that these players are the reason.
How do I vote?
