Holland is a bicycle culture, we are vying to private vehicles at the time we are competed for at work with bad price, our colleagues are coming at work with bicycle vehicles, this issue is not normal as usual.

In this environment, where everyone is doing development by looking for things, and in the environment which everyone is ready to get a solution, it is difficult to solve this problem by increasing the vehicle.

Let me think that people could not want to use public transport this year that is there, these vehicles should leave the road?

Other problems are just a view, the development is more than owning a car. I have learned.

It has been written.
