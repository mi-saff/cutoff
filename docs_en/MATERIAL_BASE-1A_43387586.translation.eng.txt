a statement by TCRA has said also it has closed for three months starting today its program take one, together with being required to evaluate it with the objective of getting a better way of driving it by taking recommendations to TCRA before that program is opened.
the deputy chairman of that committee, Joseph Mapunda has said that in the city of Dar es Salaam, when he was giving the decision of that committee concerning complaints of going against the regulations of broadcasting at that television station.
August 9, this year that station through its program of Take One that was broadcasted on air between nine o'clock and ten o'clock at night and repeated again on August 10, one o'clock up to two in the afternoon, was accused of spreading content that goes against law and principles of broadcasting.
he said the presenter of that program, Zamaradi Mketema did an interview with Gift Stanford popular by the name Gigy Money by asking her questions that aimed at sexual issues and leading her to mention the names of men she had done sex with something that intrudes into the freedom of privacy of people contrary to the regulations of broadcasting services of the year 2005.
"furthermore, in that program the presenter didn't issue a warning to viewers especially the youth and children not to involve themselves with that behavior of the interviewee rather it had the direction of motivating sexual acts and really there were no questions that led the interviewee to warn the youth and children not to enter into those acts something that can excite the girls and others to do sex business with an intention of getting money," he said.
Mapunda has emphasized regulations of broadcasting services that were gone against are quality together with honor, social morals, to avoid entering into privacy or personal life, not destroying or dirtying people's characters.
