the Revolutionary Government of Zanzibar (SMZ) has said that it is satisfied by the efforts being taken by the Cuban government in strengthening the health sector by training patriot doctors up to the point of providing treatment to the citizens.
this was said by the second Vice President, Ambassador Seif Ali Iddi, while speaking to his host the Vice President of Cuba, Salvador Mesa in his office in Vuga town, Unguja the day before.
Ambassador Iddi said that already the second batch of patriot doctors who had received advanced training on medical profession through the support of the Cuban government had started working and therefore greatly assisted in dealing with the problem of shortage of doctors.
"the contribution of the Cuban government in the health sector is great, first in training patriot doctors and second in bringing in doctors to help in the treatment of citizens of Zanzibar," he explained and requested the Cuban government to help in investment in the sector of the area of deep sea fishing.
the Cuban vice president called on Zanzibar and Cuba to form a team from both sides, that would work on using the deep sea area in promoting economic output.
Cuba was among the countries that supported the Zanzibar Revolution in the year 1964 while helping to provide assistance including provision of high level military training to the first Zanzibari youth who had formed the Zanzibar Liberation Army.
