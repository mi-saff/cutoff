Leaders of the East Africa Community Countries, have been required to prioritize implementation of policies that empower small-scale farmers and breeders, in order to make a step in development and poverty eradication.
this was said by a parliamentarian in the East African Community Parliament from Rwanda, Patrician Hajabakiga, when he was presenting a Committee report of that Parliament on development in the farming sector and tourism, at a sitting in East Africa Parliament which is going on at a Council of Representatives Chukwani, just outside the city of Unguja.
he said the time has come now to ensure farming and livestock sector are given first priorities in the countries of that community since there is enough land to strengthen agriculture and making it become a business.
he said efforts that should be done to be it is countries of the East African Community to create good policies that will enable farmers to make a big step in that sector.
however, he wanted the Government of the United Republic of Tanzania to implement Malabo's resolution of satisfying itself with enough agricultural harvest since there still are citizens who are facing the problem of poor meals, despite having a bigger space of fertile land.
in addition, East Africa Community countries have been urged to use the available opportunity to encourage businesspeople to invest in business and industrial farming.
he said farmers will add effort in producing various products including fruits if there will be industries receiving products from agricultural produce.
initially, a bill of controlling plastic products that endangers environmental pollution was presented and read for the first time by the former Minister of environment from Rwanda, parliamentarian Patricia Hajabakiga.
