In Kigoma province, some of the pregnant women with albinism living in the villages and those living around the clinic or health centers have been sitting on the important services of the clinic for the purpose of mother and child services.
The coordinator of a non-governmental organization at Ilagala health center, Tunduru District in the province, Edward Simon has urged all councils in that province to put a procedure that will enable people with albinism to get services in the clinic.
Speaking during a special seminar to enable the community to build the community about fighting against gender violence, Simon said some of the pregnant women with albinism have not been distributed to the clinic because there is no better environment and for their purpose.
"Some of them live in different villages and areas with services in the clinic and do not have reliable transport and can't walk on foot by fear for their lives due to any other faith in this community of the community," said Simon.
That coordinator has urged the government to make progress in the villages to that group and others in the community so that they can be served as required.
A resident of Msalika, a resident of Msangamkuu, Said Bilali who also has albinism said that plan is implemented and will enable women with the situation to attend in numbers to get health services.
The chairperson of Katunga County in Kigoma province, Shedrack Nsajigwa said together with urging the government through its council to put better environment for people with special needs, at the community is supposed to help that group to get important needs, at the health sector and also the society is supposed to help that group to get important needs.
