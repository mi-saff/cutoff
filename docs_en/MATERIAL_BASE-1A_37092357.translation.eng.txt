the local government of Igunga District, Tabora Region has given one week to the heads of villages and wards to arrest people who will be found without toilets in their residential areas.
the statement was issued by the acting administrative secretary of the district who is also an officer, Shadrack Kalekayo on behalf of Ivunga District Commissioner, John Mwaipopo while addressing the public at a public meeting held in Ziba Ward in the district.
the acting administrative secretary said every household is needed to focus on the whole issue of health including having good toilets and also maintaining washing hands the moment they are from the toilet to prevent infectious diseases.
however, he said in addition to the government providing education for its citizens about having toilets, there are some of the citizens who continue to ignore government directives and said such people should be arrested and taken to court.
"village and ward officials, I ask you to listen carefully and am giving seven days to ensure that you arrest all those who defied digging toilets and take them to court," said Calice.
Igunga District health officer, John Masesa said when environments are polluted it causes contagious diseases including tuberculosis, diarrhea, cholera, malaria, paralysis, polio and worms, where he said that 80 percent of these diseases are due to environmental pollution.
