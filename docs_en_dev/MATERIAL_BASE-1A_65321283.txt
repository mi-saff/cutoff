The government has a great opportunity to stop the killings.
I will support the prime minister, Kassim Majaliwa that the religious leaders must inform the killings because our country has gone into a habit of manslaughter, whose past years don't have ever happened.
We have witnessed the killings of people to be dealt with like Mwanza, Tanga and Kigamboni (Dar es Salaam). These events do not meet the theft of property but it means that when a human being of today will stop smoking among them, these killings will rise.
In addition to that, Majaliwa and asked me that the government has a great opportunity to deal with this because it has different organs like the police and the army.
God A, Arusha.
