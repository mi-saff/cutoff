I am completing with Japan .
it is a rescue group lowering bodies of the victims of the explosion that was in Japan where hundreds of mountain climbers have been trapped amidst that incident which will not happen for a period of seven years .
by depending on helicopters the rescue work has continued to move those trapped on top of the mountain and the residents from neighboring areas have explained how the thunderous stones falling have been severe and frightening .
the meteorological department in Japan has revealed that the dangerous period is not yet over with a bigger percentage being the possibility of the explosion continuing .
therefore residents neighboring the area from a distance of four kilometers from the concerned mountain should stay on high alert and the domestic flights have redirected routes except the international ones .
