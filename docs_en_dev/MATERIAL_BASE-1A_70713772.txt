The District Commissioner of Bagamoyo, Alhaj Majid Mwanga has requested the Tanzania Education and Training Authority (VETA) to build the technical school in that district to help the youths to get employment.

When closing a training on breast cancer which took place the day before yesterday in the Institute of Education and Fisheries Development (Femi) located in Bagamoyo, Bagamoyo where the training was sponsored by VETA, Mwanga said he is ready to give that authority the area for the purpose of that construction.
"We urge the Indian Ocean, East African region to put recommendations at your headquarters, that we request to build a technical school with the aim of helping our youth," said Mwanga.
He said that together with the education that will be distributed, there will be sure of getting milk that will be produced by students who will get the opportunity to join that university.
Moreover, he said that together with the presence of many land conflicts in that district, they will ensure that they are providing that area to help the development of the nation.
On his part, the acting director of VETA in that region, Asukile has said that they will ensure that they are continuing to fund the training so as to promote business and private issues.
He said the African Development Bank (MARI), donated to sponsor those training and explained that the graduates are required to use the training to produce employment to other people in order to bring development.
