New PDEA agents, hopefully do not waste their way.

It was said that it was past the newer position, a medical exam, a medical test, background investigation and panel interview of 67, new agents of the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency), PDEA of the new agents of the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency) yesterday by PDEA of the new agents of the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency, Cavite.
In the 6th encement (Examination for the Drug Enforcement Agency-Bangsamoro Basic Law in PDEA Gymnasium in PDEA Golovkin, PDEA Director General Undersecretary Arturo Cacdac, Jr, and 67, were very happy.
A few of them are sensible and some of them are taking advantage of the way towards danger, but it is not unknown to us that drugs and plague to society are not unknown to us, that is why there are many who are sensible and respected individuals who are involved in drugs.
Could it be that some of these are being proud of by the PDEA of this, lily's prayer and hopefully there is no need for the path to the new agents.
Um!
Sometimes I was able to talk to some tricycle drivers of different Toda in Quezon City and they said that many drivers are "addicts" in drugs, we believe in what our friends say, especially those who were talking.
Why do we not have anything to do with Toda Aragona, if they know that their members are using drugs, why do they need to play blind to these kinds of vices by the drivers?
Can they still wait for an accident or accident?
Hopefully, to the operators of the tricycle, before they accept their drivers, they should find out if they are involved in drugs or they know if they use them.
