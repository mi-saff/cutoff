Isiolo
Islamic leaders from the upper Eastern region have supported the ban of khat in the United Kingdom.
they want the National Authority for the Campaign against Alcohol and Drug Abuse to list the product among narcotic drugs as it has bad effects on human health.
those leaders of the union of NAMLEF led by the chairman of that organization Mister Hussein Guleid said that, the step by Britain was an urge to the government to protect children coming from areas where khat is grown in order to enable them to go to school.
he said the use of the substance has led to family breaking apart especially among pastoral communities.
he said 50 percent of people with mental disabilities in the region is due to chewing khat.
