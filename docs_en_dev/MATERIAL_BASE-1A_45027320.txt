The statements of the ministry, BMT to be careful.
, last week, the Ministry of Information, Arts, Culture and Sports together with his agency, the National Sports Council (BMT) will be issued to statements about the stand of those organs in the games of this year.
Those statements are made in a special interview with this newspaper that he wanted to hear the voice of government after starting the new year 2017.
The deputy minister of information, arts, culture, and sports, Anastazia Wambura said the government is giving a warning to leaders of sports parties that this is the year of implementation of games with actions and during the time to bring development is over.
Wambura emphasized that this year will be able to move to the leaders who are used to lead games that was involved and that the government will need implementation, success and the aim is to hold the year to be successful.
He said 2017, it should be a year for preparations for the African Community games of the year 2018, African games and the Olympic Games to continue to be done in the year 2020.
Wambura said the government wants to see every leader of the party of the game is implementing its responsibilities, including the end of the year well.
BMT, through his secretary general, Mohamed Kiganja has promised that 2017 will not be in the year to raise us to the leader of any sports party that will not be able to implement its duties well.
Kiganja said the award for the implementation of those actions, the religious leaders do not recognize them and that it will start in the district to the nation.
He said that starting from now, the preparations do not happen between leaders of sports parties and he has planned to meet with them tomorrow for the purpose of starting with strategies.
When we increase the plan especially because the government has never seen the results of the year 2016 which Tanzania continued to be the trend of the threat.
If those statements are growing, but at the basis of it you will end that it is reports of the media, we will make it in the implementation of our actions.
This is the prime minister for parties to make and implement the actions and BMT to control leaders who will sell the sports parties and to be able to bring honor to this sector.
A citizen can ask you so, Tanzania is estimated to have 50 million people for now, which could get 100 athletes who don't succeed in different games to represent Tanzania?
The truth is that many leaders of the sports parties are not in because of games, they are not in order to manage sports programs to their parties, more than to change them and check the funds of international standards that are sent in order for the development of the concerned games, but there is no action against the relevant development.
From starting, we think the ministry and BMT to deal with the level of parties that are in the country, sports that are in the country and emerged as the ones that have already been selected, the ones that will be able to meet the expectations of citizens especially the lovers of the concerned game.
We believe that together with those statements, the energy force between the ministry, BMT, directors of sports development, registrar of parties and sports clubs together with Tanzania Olympic Committee (TOC).
