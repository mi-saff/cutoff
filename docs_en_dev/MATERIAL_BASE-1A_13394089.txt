The new head coach of Yanga, George Lwandamina has said that he is a believer in a short message because it gives a chance to own football for a long time.

Lwandamina said in his philosophy of that, it will not be a lot and he was using his predecessor, Hans Pluijm, but he would like to read in a lot of work.
Lwandamina who is expected to start his official tour tomorrow Monday, said he is expecting to increase their cost because he and Pluijm their philosophy has not yet been another one.
"I would like my team to stay with the ball, I don't want the ball to stay with their opponents and the only way to prevent their opponents not to play for a short time to the time we can have, therefore, and I am a believer in a lot of life," said Lwandamina.
Also, Lwandamina said that he has seen Yanga in his last match of the first round of the Tanzania Mainland Premier League played with Ruvu Shooting and he has noticed that it is a good team that did not require a new player, since the players are in technical but he is expecting to give it a lot.
"The players are playing with more strength here and I see no strength but technical are good and the technical is very good and he promised to follow his footsteps by partnering with them to ensure Yanga gets more success.
"The goal is to ensure Yanga becomes a very big threat and it will succeed more maybe even in the African Champions League," said Lwandamina who has been from Zesco United Club of Zambia.
Lwandamina is expected to start his new responsibilities at Yanga Club on Monday with the former technical bench where the team is expecting to start exercises.
