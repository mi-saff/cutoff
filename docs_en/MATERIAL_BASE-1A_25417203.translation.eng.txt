is it a must we all talk in one particular voice?
there is an issue that has been disheartening me whenever I'm listening to radio or television programs.
that issue is, the habit of some of the presenters especially of the entertainment programs imitating the voices of other prominent presenters.
in a surprising incident, you will hear a presenter of a particular program forcing to block their nose or talk fast while pronouncing English words with an objective of sounding like another presenter.
my belief is that it's not a must for a presenter to imitate the voice of his colleague if they want to succeed, but he can talk in his voice that he was born with and still be appreciated by his listeners or viewers.
