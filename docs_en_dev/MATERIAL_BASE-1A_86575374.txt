It is true, we need this law to destroy 22 people.

In the third page of this newspaper, we have made news about the meeting of leaders of the African Anti-Corruption Bureau (EAGI), that started on Monday this week in Mwanza town.

Different leaders have spoken at that meeting, giving recommendations and advice to improve the fight against corruption in the East African countries.

Among the speakers are together with the deputy chairperson of the Ethics Committee and Marine Transport Regulatory Authority (EPOC), Irene Uwoya, together with other things, Kenwanja, has advised Tanzania to have a special law to follow the monitoring of its resources that have been stolen, that is Assa Mwakilembe.

Together with the existence of law to protect witnesses, we think it is an appropriate time for Tanzania to have laws of that way, that is independent and not to put that section within other laws.

There are several important reasons for supporting that advice and the biggest thing is the truth that, our economy as a nation continues to open up day up to day, the challenges of controlling our economic system will also be able to grow up.

Business opportunities in the country are required to open up while the speed of the growth of human resources if it reaches the increase in those challenges and others that is not easy to understand here, it is clear that they will have loopholes of corruption.

Inside that list of expansion of the economy and the speed of the growth of human resources, theft, and corruption of resources are important now to have laws of the way, although, experience has confirmed that, in Tanzania, the foundation problem is not law but it's the management of the law.

However, in addition to recognizing that the foundation problem is not law but the management of law, it is also good to continue improving and even make new good laws for faith that, one day, managers of these laws will come out.

We recognize that the fight against corruption and theft of human resources are war that need the use of all weapons because it can be available.

We have no need to choose weapons in the fight against corruption and corruption, and we have no need to choose what to use the weapons it's true, the country needs a law to follow the resources that are destroyed, parliament and executives who are proud of being keen on this advice.
