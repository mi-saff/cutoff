HPadilla in politics?

Tac Padilla, a famous businessman, gave and continues to bring honor to the country as a shooting champion.
And from the business and sports who talked about his image, one "Tac Padilla" is also mentioned in the world of politics and there are many people who will increase their eyebrows and will not believe in the spreading news, but that is the gossips in Brgy. San Agustin of Malabon.
The report, the residents themselves are the ones who are able to convince the shooting "to run in the coming October 28 of the elections.
But it is very impossible, Tac Padilla, to enter the complicated world of politics, will run as chairman of Barangay San Agustin?
"That is certain that they will surely be playing in the minds of those who are able to identify Tac. Sports icon, something is being said in life, everyone might have something to Tausug.
But on the other hand, the neighbors of Tac has a reason why they want them to fall asleep in the field of politics.
What we see, those from San Agustin, who are from Taisan, are in good hands for their barangay.
If Tac is lucky to be elected as chairman, San Agustin will reach the prosperity that the residents want to progress.
As successful and having a heart attack, it is easy for those from San Agustin to come near and ask for help from him.
As a matter of fact, the Padilla family has made a lot of things done by the said barangay, according to the residents.
Because it's simple and has no ego in yourself, in spite of the high state, the respect of those from San Agustin will prevail.
And if respect is prevailed between the residents and leaders of the barangay, there is no doubt that the barangay runs properly.
But the question: Taisan is being encouraged by the neighbors to say that he ran and even captain of San Agustin.
For us, if this is called by the public service, wow, Tac should accept the challenge of her neighbors.
