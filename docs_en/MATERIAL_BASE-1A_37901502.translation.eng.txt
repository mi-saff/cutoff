electronic tickets will start to work officially, during the match of soccer rivals in the country Simba and Yanga, in October first this year.
while talking in his office in Dar es Salaam yesterday, Minister of Information, Culture, Art and Sports, Nape Nnauye said that the tickets will be tested on the September 25th game involving Simba and Yanga.
"there are friendly matches to contribute to the earthquake victims in Kagera region, it will involve Bongo Movie and Bongo Fleva, members of parliament for Simba and Yanga and we shall test the electronic tickets for the first time in those games.
everything is ready and after those temptations, since the Simba and Yanga competition those tickets will start being used officially to help seal loopholes, (revenue thieves) entry revenues have been stolen for a very long time," stressed Nape.
the Sunday of September 11, 2016, Minister Nape, officially launched the use of those tickets in the National Stadium.
the system is a directive of the Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa concerning revenue controls at the entrances whereby it is a system that will require a fan to have a card like ATM ones, that will enable him to make purchases/payments while also having the ability to buy tickets for matches that he likes through the same card.
among those given the cards to the stadium's entrance are Minister Nape, President John Magufuli and his vice president Samia Suluhu Hassan as a mobilization where the smart card will be released free of charge to the fans and after that he will begin to enter the stadium after depositing money in it.
another benefit of the system is that there will no longer be a mechanism to divide revenue manually to the relevant institution, instead, if you want a ticket, the sharing percentage will be done more technologically to TFF, TRA, BMT and other relevant parts.
