Alcohol and cigarettes!

What we remember is that while the senators are fighting war, congressmen and from the Palace about alcohol and Joseph.
During the rainy season, when you travel the heat from La Union to Ilocos Norte, the crops of farmers are almost going to be eaten.
I have made a conflict with rice during rainy season.
You will also earn money in Cagayan and Isabela. And in Cordillera, there are also many who plant clothes.
I really have a big livelihood.

If it is rainy season when I talks and rice, it can be clearly seen how big the box of the tornado is seen on the side of the house of the farmers, there are also many bottles of stray dogs, width and others.
There are also many scattered everywhere.
From the various stores, as well as the number of snack, only ten and soap are the amount of cigarettes and alcohol that they sell.
This is even if there are those who die and are taking advantage of alcohol and Mary, even if someone dies from alcohol and cigarettes.

We even noticed something, regular customers, and alcohol has no taxes.
Now, there is usually no tax which is being thrown out and being harvested.
Ah, those filled with coconut milk, coconut wine, and based on usual taxes.
It is only then that there is a need to buy the criticisms that will be used by factories of alcohol and conformity, if there is an occasion like Kdey and celebration.
Isn't it?
While those in Congress and the Palace have a war there, those who seem to be laughing and experienced the negative comments that I have made.
They will just laugh at the flowery plants, coconut wine, based on top of alcohol from rice.
The life of alcohol and Mary, most of all, fights that hit here, especially those who depend on pork barrel from tax from vices.
