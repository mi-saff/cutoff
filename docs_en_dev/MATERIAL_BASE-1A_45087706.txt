The list of the United Republic will be followed.
Mr, 13, 2014.

About the qualifications to be elected as the presidential candidate or the Parliament (article 10 and 125 million), for now the parties love your work hard to convince him to vie as a candidate so that some of the party members do not know that the national results could have any other leaders.
I advise that it is growing, and the instrument to filter those candidates should be taken by the party to be done by the authority to convince the authority to convince the authority to implement this responsibility, commission that will be led by lack of leadership that were listed in this constitution.
There are other countries with the procedure of preventing themselves without having an instrument they will remain in papers and things will continue to be used by the nation that has been able to get the bad leaders.
Parliament to give him the president.

It is my opinion that the level used by 75 percent of the members of parliament for the purpose of creating a committee of research and removing the president is very high because of creating that committee with 66 percent (two-thirds) to do not get more than 50 percent.
Also, the constitution will be a president or leader who was removed from power because it deserves to be paid the voluntary benefits of pension funds, as it is for other public servants who be expelled from work.
The process of changing the constitution.

This will also be faced with the experience that we got played with the weight of the constitution passed by the citizens and the citizens to change the constitution should not be easy if this procedure was done, which is being used now because this procedure is used now.
I pray first, two-thirds of the members of parliament from Tanganyika and two-thirds from Zanzibar will be called as they are now.
Two-thirds of the opposition members of parliament - these are representing the citizens who registered themselves, third, a step that is intended to be big between 119 that was prepared and supported.
The establishment of the Parliament of parliament.
Article 113, it needs good analysis, should not happen annually and I see the election manifesto, his candidate will have a lot of candidates to elect members of parliament of the East African Community, but if the president will be elected by the citizens and let him do that.
Responsibilities of the director of elections.
Responsibilities of the director of elections (article 196) - that, "the Elections Director of the Electoral Commission will implement its responsibilities by being assisted by executives who are public servants, who wanted the commission to employ themselves or to select his servants who will be responsible for him.
The sources of government revenue.
In the sources of income of the government of the United Republic of Tanzania (article 231), it would like the proposal, in my opinion, it will give birth to the government so that it does not have the authority to run taxes to its citizens so that it can serve them.
We want the government of the United Republic with great strength and this is together with the ability to get enough revenue to run the government of the United Republic of the revenue to contribute to every citizen with the ability to pay taxes, in accordance with the law.
