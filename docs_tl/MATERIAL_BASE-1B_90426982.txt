Happiest.

It is the happiest person (Mt. 11: 28-30) who is the most happy person in this world?

That is the rich?

They are in favor of going to be a disadvantage and are going to be a candidate for them to always give all the attention of those who are looking up to them.

That are those with power?, they are the king and leaders who will be given the ability to implement the law and their will should be followed, that is why it can be followed that's why it can be followed.

"They are the brains you have the ability to understand even if we're going to understand whatever it is that when we go to Jesus, that is where we can see all the real happiness that is why when we go to Jesus, you will lose all the wrong appreciation of what we are holding on!

Not the rich.

I am happy when I wake up without a cold!
