Every May Uno, SONA, November 30, and other action, they will get rid of the streets the so-called "Tulay ng Manggagawa sa Hunan," but how do they understand that the Filipino Workers who will free the country from the budget of capital, especially the release of the workers, is in their own hands.

The problem of the workers is on him, because he still has no trust on his own strength, and he still does not know his real strength, that is why he still does not know his real strength, which is why he still does not know that he is being used by the millions of workers in the country, that is why he still hasn't been used to stop the factory in the country, that is why he can stop in the factory of the country, that is why he can stop the private sector of the country.

That is the strength of the workers that they have not seen until now.

Because the workers think of himself, just a simple employee, just a simple employee back to their factories, factory or office so that the workers do not know their interest in their jobs, that they are the ones who have lost their things in their jobs, that's why they are the ones who have lost their things in their jobs, that they are the same with their own properties.

The workers need to know himself as a type, because this is the first field of fight, to free the workers from the level of wage increase, for all, they should be aware of the kind of workers who have the goal to crush their rivals, the type of capitalists have.

As aware of the kind of workers, what they need to prepare for is the construction of a Filipino workers who will be transferred to the rotten system, until they will build their scheduled society, the community does not take care of the people, the Philippine SOSalas.
