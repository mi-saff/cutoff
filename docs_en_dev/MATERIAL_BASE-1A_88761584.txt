If there is a incident that has shaken the nation last week, it is not a strike of doctors especially but they were kidnapped, as a result of the murder of the leader of the strike, Doctor Stephen Mashishanga.
The night before Wednesday last Wednesday, the nation was ready and the beginning of a strike of doctors, being found to be aired on his other day which now it has begun to take it up because there are people who can do anything without any person and there is no need to prevent it.
Contrary to the situation, said that Commander Suleiman Kova has been postponed by President Jakaya Kikwete, that they were kidnapped by President Jakaya Kikwete, that they were kidnapped is a new issue and happened for the first time, "the truth is that this issue has already begun being normal and ranches.
There is a case of the young man of Ubungo who was kidnapped the night before the small elections in Igunga, as the young man, who is called Mbwana Masoud ran away from mysterious circumstances.
He was born in Igunga, as one of the voters of the Party of Democracy and Development (CHADEMA). It was not known where he is up to a few days later, his body was found found guilty, there were people who are doing exercises for their dirty activities.
It's a must that we know where the members of parliament from CHADEMA was attacked by police but no one who was arrested until now?
An incident that was attacked by Doctor Ulbrahim and the fact that the saying that seems to have forgotten that one person's meat and now can't leave anything and because these people who had already begun to stop the mistakes of people being left to live as it was for Doctor Ulbrahim.
Thirst for killing people is not new in our country, or in other parts of the world, especially when the leaders do not have an issue of defending himself more than using strength and who will happen that the death of Steve Bis in South Africa?

People are saying that Julius Nyerere's administration was very disturbing, there is a person who can make someone who had gone to or a series of people whose bodies were not enough for now, the young man will have lived in exile as usual?

However, if we agree that you feel that all actions (together with Arumeru East Africa) have been done by conmen, so we can believe in any way that our government is prepared to deal with it?
Recently, we have written the way the Albino Society believe that they were kidnapped by the brutal killings and how it took time to our government to control those acts but more than the Tanzanian Albino Society, we are thinking that this group will be able to control those acts of ranches.
I have been saying that there is a probability that other people have been found again and that I will be doing or look at what happened and be able to attain that we have no great ability to deal with these actions?
What is going on more, and if our citizens seem to be accepted, it is true that the criminal activities can be taken by the commission but we are seen in Songea, but we saw Tabora?
If the commission were leading the country there would be no ministers or different institutions that have been made to do the commission so that the commission is supposed to participate in the crime and if the ones being mentioned are top officials of the army.
But the real thing is that if it is true that there are people who are used by others to do things like this and it takes more than one week to the police to think about anyone, then the threat to our nation's security is very big than we can't like to think.
Think about it would have been affected by that issue, he is the minister or head of the province.
I think about one of the popular ministers, he went up with his morning that was found in Mabwepande claimed to be buried and it was caught with sharp teeth.
Think about people and security would have been able to have the call.
Currently, it would have taken five days or the establishment of the commission meaning the response of President could be like this?

Or let's go ahead, think about this way is one of the national senior leaders who is mentioned to have been affected by news media or he is involved with some certain things and then he was found with no other country then they had been told to find those who did that action?
Actually, I think about the feelings of some people that "the leader of the strike that he used" were so for the great child?

Try to see you easily available on this issue and think that Doctor Kizza Byanyima came back.
If his life will be issued to this reason, especially because he has been hurt me, then you should know where we live in different times, at times, there is no one to sign him, even if it is one brother.
It's not a time to live in peace and peace, unity, calmness and togetherness and "if they have been able to do these things like a famous person like Doctor Ulbrahim and if they were able to look for anyone, if they have been able to look for parliamentarians to be remembered even if they are able to look for parliamentarians.
The big issue is to look at the story which they do not get the meaning, "he was walking with someone's wife," if people think and believe this statements are given quickly, then we have a great problem because our killers will be sitting on.
