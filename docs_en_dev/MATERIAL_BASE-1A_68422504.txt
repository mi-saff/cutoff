Zitto Kabwe, his responsibility is the source of corruption through sharp teeth.

I am happy that in the condition that I wrote them inside my mother and put up in political politics.

Oriflame Cosmetics company is owned by artists, Charles Gombe (C) is a company that does not make benefits (Company Limited) and does not have any business interests.

The artists of Kigoma have done work with TANAPA with NSSF, work that are being known as they are.

Today, the one who given any NSSF employee will help the work of those artists.

The period in which my mother is in critical condition and the member of the executive committee of their party, my condolences to that is given that is.

There is no way of missing his humanity does not know more than soon.

By Zitto Kabwe.
