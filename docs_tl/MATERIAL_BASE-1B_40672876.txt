Charter change, Tatsuya Nakamura, where there is a change.

David D, Angelo.
Shame - Shame, opinion - opinion, President Rodrigo Duterte.

Senator Leila de Lima has been laid down and removed from their positions in the Senate and Vice President Leni Robredo is buried in his position at the Libingan ng mga Bayani, while the war in Mindanao will continue to be buried in the Libingan ng mga Bayani.

When is the change?

Within six months when President Rodrigo "Digong" Duterte did not lose their position, more than six months have passed and it seems that there is no clear change that happened in our country, more than 7,000 people have surrendered and said that this is a big change in our country, that is why I salute these events.

However, there are other things or even if the traffic in EDSA gets broken, the train in EDSA becomes stronger, and there is still a problem with the former administration but is it not said that he will change?

It is prohibited to complain?

Can it be prohibited to complain or not agree with the president's orders?, it is scary that President Duterte should stop his abilities but it is scary that a woman like Senator Leila de Lima should have been removed now, there are evidences and charged.

What is happening in our country?
