Among the news that made him, in this week, it's this matter that concern the church leader in Kasanga village, Geita District, who stopped him by sending him after being accused of killing her daughter by using Aisee Mjengwa.

The reports indicate that Mbazi Manase 36, an ex-fielder from the East African Church (AICT) gave a punishment to her daughter of the 15 year old lady she is accusing to be involved in the acts of blocking him, while standing on the road while standing in the environment, he started by MONDE.
Witnesses say he went to home where he sent away from home and continued to accumulate points until when he found her heart, he decided to run away and when he came into a distance of approximately one kilometers from the scene, he put him a distance of approximately one kilometers from the scene.
An eye has witnessed these reports on media stations which have been confirmed by the police commander of Geita Province, Mponjoli Mwabulambo has said that the news reports have witnessed some people who are mocking him from a lot of questions that are not affected in this event.
Others told him Mbiku that he was a good teacher who doesn't have a lot of crime and for sure it is very disturbing, how this religious leader was affected before the rights, the incident that had caused the deaths, is a lesson to me.
It is a big thing not only for parents and guardians but another person with the authority of Plasmodium falciparum.
There are a lot of events that parents, guardians, teachers have been found guilty in removing the anger of his results injured and manslaughter.
Among the events I have ever read in the media includes the mother of a mother in Tabora province who had reduced his daughter aged four years since the age of four years were reduced because of false accusations and not at home.
If you look at the eye of his guidance, there is no one who did her child to go up, but now, the way that was used for many years, was led by the anger, his mother was found in an offense. I'll remember, he is a mother of one woman in Mtwara Province who contributed her a child of four years for an offense of eating wild life.
He took the spider plant, put him in the hands and then put a fire with the mother who was interviewed, he asked the foundation that he took that step to warned the child.
But that is not the source of this mother to be taken against them, I believe there are parents and guardians who have not found themselves with great punishment to their children believing that you can affect any person depending on the environment of an issue.
But it should be understood that, without caring about the mistake that he did a child or another person or those of your eyes, it will fall down and caused injuries or killing, no security.
This is an example of the results of parents and guardians to marry off their daughters, because a few days ago, Christian Bella (35) found himself being beaten seven years in prison for the mistake of filling it two legs and caused her severe pain.
That judgment was issued by the resident magistrate of Ilala district, John Msafiri who said that the court has organized a statement made by the charges given by five witnesses including the doctor and that the judgment should be a lesson to other parents who do such actions.
The primary issue, is to learn to control the anger on the time of rescuing their children without caring about different issues that destroy the situation for example, among events that were reported to parents or killed and injured their children, they will find some of their own problems and other economic problems.
While every person needs to control the anger of any decision, also the society is supposed to help in save and save children against great punishment offered by the person who lost the reputation through a child or a person who is giving a stern warning to the child.
For instance, according to Mbazi Manase 36, there is an indication that if the community including his family, it would have intervened in a short time to carry out of her daughter, those deaths have failed because there are people in our community and they are known as popular by giving a stern punishment for children.
But it is very common without knowing that one day, those actions can cost the lives of their children and we should not understand the lives of their children and even a whole person, therefore we should learn to control the anger and we can have a punishment.
