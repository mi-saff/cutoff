Tucta now invents new tactics to compete for employers
Kigoma/Kahama
organization of independent workers union of Tanzania (Tucta) has asked the Government to put in place laws to revoke registrations of employers who prevent their employees from joining that organization for the fear of being prompted for the interest of those workers.
organizer for this year's Labor Day Celebration (First May), Mussa Mhagama recently said that there are organizations of big companies such as the cotton plucking, oil processing, industries, dispensaries and health facilities whose employees are not coming out to join the organization.
"let me request leaders of workers unions to get into those areas to register workers, and an employer who will refuse, Government to intervene including revoking the registration for conducting his activities," said Mhagama.
the ruling Secretary Shinyanga Province, Albert Msovela said the Government will not hesitate to take action to an employer who shall be identified to be preventing his employees from not joining the union.
he also warned that, an action will be taken to an employer who shall be identified to have sacked an employee who had joined those unions,
"I am ordering all district leaders in Shinyanga Province to ensure that all employers in private sector are giving their employees freedom of joining independent workers union, which are better foundation of defending their interest," said Msovela.
at the same time, the Head of Kigoma Province, Emmanuel Maganga required citizens to become ambassadors of denying and rebuking corruption.
"corruption is a big enemy, but the giver of bribe and the recipient are all wrong.
citizens are the biggest institution of fighting corruption, help the Government to arrest those who are involved with those illegal acts," said Maganga.
