by Hamida Hassan
bongo movie star Aunt Ezekiel has confessed her husband has been arrested and experiencing challenges but not jailed as some people are spreading rumors.
telling stories with our writer recently, Aunt said her husband Sunday Demonte was arrested as a result of his visa being outdated where he was held for a while and after sorting the required procedure, he was released.
"I am so surprised this rumor has spread that I have left my husband to be jailed, the truth is that my husband is free and if you wish you can talk to him right now, which woman would be this happy when her husband has trouble?"
questioned Aunt.
in other lines, Aunt said that many people desire to see her abandoned or to know the progress of her life with her husband but they lie to themselves for she is a woman who has decided to get married and she is contented so they will not gain anything.
"it is not easy for me to disclose the secret of the life I live with my husband, it is our agreement.
basically our marriage is stable, they will wait for long and they will be tired themselves," said Aunt.
