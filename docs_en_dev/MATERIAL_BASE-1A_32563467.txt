The referees of the First Division League will be completed.
Editor, there have been ten commandments of referees that refereed that match of the Premier League, the truth is that there is every reason to follow up even in the high level matches, that there is things that can't be avoided.
I think there is every reason to start following these referees of the First Division League that is the main level of the premier league, its results have risen up and played as a result of the referees to be taken to the premier league, even in the low level league.
I believe TFF and the league supervisors will be keen on this I am saying and to bring changes in attacks.
