Third!

I hope I have done all my feelings further.

Most of the patients are regretful why they lost strength that they lose their feelings, so that they should not be involved in the flow of their conscience, it's as if they were irked by their conscience, so they were irked by their conscience, and why they were amazed by the flow of others.

Always according to him, lazy, complained and escaping to avoid the government as if he does not want to do anything but do not want to meddle, but like what is expected, they have already accepted the usual situation instead of revealing their real feelings.

As a result, they had a critical condition that has a relationship with worry, evil, and rape for them to be able to recover.

At around 1: Even at work, in a relationship, or a business partner, we often talk to our hearts, instead, we need to let us go back to our emotions, we should also learn how to end our emotions, instead, we should also learn how to be involved in our emotions, and we should have expressed that it is appropriate to help in a happy relationship.

What is right, hide and hide what you feel, or make sure that this will ease whatever precautions in your mind?
