The round of the premier league round, recently, and for now the team are in the process of improving their squads, for the second round of the league that had been planned to officially start early next month.

Already some of the clubs have already started fighting for the signing of new players for the purpose of strengthening their squads for different goals.
Rocks, Yanga and Azam were playing for championship, there are Mbao FC, water, water, African Lyon and others will go in fighting for a bridge.
The biggest thing, the players are required to be careful, not to qualify for their decisions to place ink in different teams. Players will ask you to work hard by fans and the club leaders, especially the last time they vote.
Players, especially upcoming poets, it is a must that you will get their ability and the club they want to go for them if they are able to help them and be able to help them to promote their talents or fighting and in the end they are veterans in the age of age.
The registration period is Christmas season and it's not for players, but even the aides and the club's coaches will lead to the registration to be cleaned it for the benefit of both sides because of the players and the concerned club, so as to see in the end of Tanzania's football.
We will not expect it's like that which happened at a big registration exercise, when Hassan Kessy where he won the contract with Simba, a decision that until today will not know the fate of his case which Simba have decided to be paid 600 million shillings.
The first round, we have witnessed some of the players while signing up due to cheating and caused the committee of law and integrity of players of Tanzania Football Federation (TFF).
The problem of cheating in the players have been seen to be sustainable in Tanzania, although for a period, it does not reach yourself especially in the premier league but in the levels of accidents, there have been great and complaints have been many.
In the premier league, the players to register two teams have been a normal issue and has already taken the ears of soccer stakeholders, due to the case they get into time to time.
All times the registration of controversy in the premier league even if it is wrong, we are involved in the old club of Simba and Yanga.
All cases that you have shaken the media here in the country depend on those clubs themselves by themselves or they will face another club where they are able to do their player.
We have also witnessed the players going into a lot of mistakes like that, that were ever done by players in the previous years and given punishment by TFF, but the issue has been seen that it's difficult for the players.
I have not said, the use of money, the Fukeni Mighty One, the law will have reduced some of the players and they find themselves entering a conflict between those players and even when they put up a chance to be involved in soccer for a period of six months until one year.
The Football Association of Tanzania Football Association (Sputanza), although it does not affect the punishment but he believes that there is good that stern legal action will be taken to stop the habit of cheating and building discipline in the soccer game.
"If we will defend this issue, we will continue to cheating, but many times you are supposed to play in life or one year because this is a must that we build the discipline for our players to discover themselves and to respect the law," says the Secretary General of Sufiani, Mussa Msepwa.
When you talk about now, the time for players to register their party so that they can be able to help them to manage their contracts and not to wait until before the dispute between their clubs.
They should support players of the premier league and the first level league on the rights and their responsibilities, freedom in issues of registration and other important issues that give mistakes for players especially in contracts and registration.
The players should be keen in entering the contracts and if it will be possible to have lawyers in planning.
I believe these things are done keenly and the great keenness of both sides to the leaders and coaches of the club are clear that we can witness the second largest in the first round that ended with Simba competing with 35 points.
