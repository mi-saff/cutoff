The Provincial Commissioner of Arusha, Mrisho Gambo has wanted the Tanzania Bureau of Standards (TBS) and other stakeholders to partner in state and property to ensure they control the poor quality and poor products that are imported and those made in the country.

In the speech that was read on behalf of the head of Ngorongoro District, Rashid Mtaka, in the fourth meeting of the stakeholders of improving education that is taking place here, Gambo said the country is facing a huge disaster spread in poor products that are not low standards as well as a huge amount of poverty to its citizens.
He said that it's supposed to be controlled by all the stakeholders in those sectors as well as the citizens by exposing those involved, TBS and other stakeholders, are supposed to partner in state and property to deal with that situation so that Tanzania should not be the source of products that have no standards.
In addition to providing the TBS together with other stakeholders, Gambo urged the investors to boycott the poor and poor products, because it is the only way of killing the products of those products.
