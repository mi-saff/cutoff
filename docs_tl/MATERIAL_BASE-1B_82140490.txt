Truth by PNoy.

Manny Pacquiao proved that he came from boxing when he defeated American boxing Program (Chris Algieri on the 12-year-old son, which also fell to Luna up to six times after he was hit by the strong punches of Pacman.
Algieri seemed like a chore that does not do anything but to dance and run around the morning so that he would just avoid getting carried by the national fist.
Algieri has not moved away, in the latest win of Manny that this is a proof that he is capable of fighting even the World Boxing boxer's why if Floyd Mayweather is brave, they should have fought for who really is against Pacquiao and the boxer of it.
It's because it's difficult for Maysilo, this is just all talk and the truth is, that's why he does not want to fight, he might lie down to Luna when he was hit by the fist of Pacman and Pacman.
