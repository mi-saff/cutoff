you can put a system for life insurance that when I retire I be given benefits and some life insurance policies also pay benefits if the policy holder travels and meets a death tragedy permanent disability temporary disability injury that needs therapy treatment and even be compensated funeral expenses or transportation of the body .
or the same way it is used as something of an investment plan and be paid benefits in the future after the number of years that you chose in life policy have elapsed .
and families have gone into poverty after the breadwinner died or got a permanent disability .
I speak this considering for example a father or mother is the breadwinner in a family in that house went to a bank or an loaning association and took out a loan in order to advance their family .
<no-speech>
unluckily because everything was planned by Almighty God they died .
<no-speech>
that means they will not be able to pay the loan .
and he put the house as collateral for that loan .
<no-speech>
if they don't have life insurance it is possible for that family to get into big trouble because their collateral will be used to pay back the loan to the relevant institution .
<no-speech>
but careful people nowadays who take life insurance even the loan ones and they get a profit from us life insurance companies to go and pay any remainder of the loan .
if the tragedy befalls a borrower who is a family breadwinner .
