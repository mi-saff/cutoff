Shilole opens up to friends who want to frustrate her relationship with Nuh Mziwanda!
bongo musician and bongo film maker, Zuwena Mohamed 'Shilole', has decided to clear the source of his dispute with her prospective husband, Nuh Mziwanda as friends.
Shilole claimed that they had often been fighting, but the source was a blurring statement from their close friends who aimed at separating them.
the lady claimed that from that situation, she has now decided not to involve them in any issue concerning her life in order to reduce frequent conflicts between them.
she said those around them are most likely to contribute to conflicts in their relationships, considering that they are now in the process of getting married after the parents of both sides accepted their relationship.
"we have noticed that friends are the ones coming between us because my boyfriend always receives information about me while they are the ones bringing me information about him, this has led to my need for many friends to be hypocrites," she said.
