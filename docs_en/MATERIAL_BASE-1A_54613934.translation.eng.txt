maybe some people specifically farmers of cashew nuts would like to know the behaviors of cashew nuts in the production of more and better produce how does it work ?
the absolute first step in the production of cashew nut is to plant the produce of the season .
<no-speech>
if you take a look in this farm is that in the period of the past years the time the opportunity of cashew nut had not started to crowd I used to plant here -- I used to plant cow pea and green gram .
I used to plant other produce for example cassava .
<no-speech>
and that is then the first period because if you have done so %incomplete
meaning cashew nut benefits the time you are planting those produce but similarly and you also gain that your farm remains pure and your cashew nut grows in a clean state but similarly you get extra food .
<no-speech>
but when the cashew nut begins to come close to each other and the leaves move near each other like it is now in this farm you find that the spaces for planting the products of the season have reduced .
and -- if they have become reduced it means you cannot plant the produce therefore ploughing and taking care of those produce becomes not there .
the result is that the weeds sprout in large number .
and on many parts that are farming the produce of cashew nut you find that the weed period you find that you cultivate between twice or three times in a season .
and is very huge cost if you are using a hand hoe or casual workers to cultivate .
now these weeds right now are a big problem .
<no-speech>
and it is a big problem because in the southern areas for example in Mtwara province and -- and Mtwara province even specifically Rindi region where cashew nut are planted largely the weed period is a big problem and it's a problem because the period of -- of using hands or using a hoe it forces you to cultivate at least twice or three times in a season before you start to pick cashew nuts .
now if you can maybe you farm in the process like I did me .
that you plough by tractor therefore by a big potion those weeds reduce and your farm becomes in a clear state .
but more than there is that we have big problems of different types of weeds that germinate on the cashew nut farms .
and this has led to the level which even the use of plants spraying chemicals in order to control weeds it has been seen also as a problem or a problem of -- of -- which has -- has -- it is in -- in half baked knowledge .
and you say half baked knowledge because when you use the spraying chemicals for example a drug called glyphosate .
the drug of glyphosate kill weeds .
there is no -- there is no objection on that .
but what type of weeds ?
weeds of grass -- grass weeds that thrive for one season or two they die very easily .
but the weeds we are seeing these ones -- of the bush %incomplete
<no-speech>
these bush weeds even when the drugs kill weeds it seems to be unable to kill these weeds .
<no-speech>
generally the activities of cashew nut faming is faced by different challenges being together with harvesting where the harvester is forced to squat or bend their waists for a long time so that she can pick sort out and peel off the skin of cashew nut .
<no-speech>
now you know cashew nut is picked .
<no-speech>
when it reaches the time of picking that is a big job harvesting of cashew nut .
this is like plucking this one .
<no-speech>
you pluck you sit down you pluck until the waist starts to pain .
it is the big job %incomplete
that is the work of cashew nut did not explain these ones like that woman translated or explained .
work of cashew nut is a procedure this big job is to bend and collect together these cashew nut then also when collecting together to take various ones then you can sit in a section here you work and that job causes a lot of pain .
<no-speech>
this back can pain you a lot because of sitting for a long time .
therefore that is the way cashew nut work is .
<no-speech>
therefore of employment you can just tell the employer that this here I have got five plastics or I have gotten four plastic that way you go to deliver to who employed you .
now if is in your room then you harvest you know that I have got one sack for today then you go to keep it at home and a day after tomorrow I don't know if you come back you go to harvest you go to return at your home it is then till you know that right now I have got five sacks six sacks seven sacks to take to the market to want the money needs now .
you are paid eight hundred shillings .
