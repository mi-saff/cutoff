Angel, is still bathing in the Darna.
Amazing, irritable and irritable.
By Ginger RL-August 13, 2016, Angel Locsin.
Director Erik Matti will leave to America so he can't answer if Angel Locsin was the one who will lead to the movie.
This project has long been discussed but the people involved have no statement yet.
There was an issue that Angel was about to go out of issue, but there was still no statement yet, we asked one of the Productions, we asked, he still has no statement regarding this, he has not heard anything from the Star yet as to who really is.
But it is likely that this next year will be the start, so it seems that Angel is just waiting for Angel that she will bear the heavy scenes in the said film.
However, there are still some who also talk about us that the production they spent is big, which they have done and released last Metro Manila Film Festival.
It was almost a week when he took a shot but there was an accident where some people were wounded.
Some of the protesters said, there was an accident but it was discovered that some who were wounded were treated.
He did not give details to us what happened, but the some who were wounded in the accident took a shot.
