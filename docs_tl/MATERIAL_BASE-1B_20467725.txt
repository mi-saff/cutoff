According to witnesses, hopefully, it is possible.

A good news was made by Humalig Diaz's gift to those who met him last Thursday afternoon at the airport at his arrival from Rio de Jannatul.
Everyone thought that he will finish his joining the international competition after the silver medal last Sunday.

But he said, he is ready to continue his career and join the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games.
But before that, he was asked for P5 million pesos and a house to buy a vacant lot in their house in Zamboanga and will bring a vacant lot to buy the youth in their place where the police will be tested which brought him to success.
P5 million for his plan is not enough but for sure there are good things that will help to push through what he wants to happen.
Hopefully, Diaz is not fed up with his hard training as a difficult training for him to be able to join the Tokyo four years from now.
I remember what happened in 1996 when he went home with the silver medal of Onyok because of the Atlanta Olympics when she invited her in showbiz and because she has its own intelligence in comedy, she was given Break.
The thing is, Onyok is not going back to boxing even if the trend in showbiz is not easy to go back to boxing where he needs to wake up early for jogging and training, where he needs to maintain his weight, where he needs to make a sacrifice everyday.
Not long after, Onyok is put in boxing and have chosen a colorful life in showbiz.

It's a shame that since then, Onyok is only 21 years old and I hope this is ripe if he joined the 2000 Sydney Olympics.
Hopefully this is not what will happen to Diaz, that they would surely get rid of the Philippines with the year of the Philippine.
