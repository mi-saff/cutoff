The grounds of CCM are required to have a better infrastructure.
The editor of several weeks ago I heard the Minister of Information, Nape Nnauye saying the Tanzania Football Federation (TFF) has a responsibility to sit with stakeholders including the owners of plots, to check the procedure of putting modern equipment in the premier league matches so as to be easy to serve the players they have had problems in the field.
Nape gave that advice in Mwanza town, during the preparation of a special game that was organized to contribute to the family's family, Ismail Jusa Ladu, who lost life in a heart attack at the end of last year.
CCM is the owners of the grounds like CCM Kirumba, Sokoine, Majimaji, Nangwanda Sijaona Stadium in Jamhuri, Morogoro, Dodoma and Dodoma, as the owner of the grounds, CCM has a responsibility of putting important medical services to the players.
Ndeki.
