viewer of the program of the sister know yourself excellent sister until then we have come close to the end of the program .
but I told you sister I haven't bid Ana goodbye because there is an issue which we would like to hear and what answers is she giving us or what is her perspective ?
and the issue itself is the very same one which we had our question on .
we say it's your chance to expand your knowledge concerning that issue .
you could take it lightly but it's a big thing which is in our everyday lives .
and our children's and so on .
therefore we have a question where we said fellows we have had children .
and sister Ana also has a child she is raising so when a child is chocked what steps do you take ?
what do you do ?
therefore our question will also go to sister Ana .
sister Ana .
<no-speech>
do you have a child that you are raising pardon ?
yes .
when he is choked what do you do ?
when he is choked I can give him water .
yes .
so what do you give the water for ?
<no-speech>
so as to prevent him from choking further .
if he is choked what does he do ?
<no-speech>
when he is choked he behaves like he's getting strangled by something .
when he's strangled what does he usually do ?
he looks fixedly or he gets an unyielding cough .
ahh ahh now do you give water instantly to someone who's coughing ?
<no-speech>
come on have some pity .
yes .
<no-speech>
is that coming ?
<no-speech>
have you ever done that ?
<no-speech>
I have ever done it .
<no-speech>
did he therefore drink this water ?
<no-speech>
I did drink myself because I got choked myself .
no I started drinking water .
and did it stop ?
yes .
do you therefore believe that when a child chokes you should give him water ?
I can give him water .
okay alright .
fellows these are sister Ana's answers .
now what do you do if a child chokes ?
do send us your answer .
therefore it's a very basic question and I ask what do people usually do ?
and where did they learn it from ?
but technically why does a person get choked and what is required to be done and in which way ?
you'll get answers right here but don't be in a hurry .
we first want to hear what answers different people have ?
and which answers do you too have ?
<no-speech>
<no-speech>
we are heading to the very end of the program but we have a gift for our sister .
sister Ana we have a gift for you we don't know how you'll receive it .
but for our gift we would like to know if you have a bank account ?
<no-speech>
no there is no account .
and have you ever desired to have an account ?
yes .
mm and so when you get your salary where do you keep it if you don't have an account ?
<no-speech>
me when I put -- when I get my salary I just keep it inside .
but I really would have liked to open an account at this time .
mm .
yes .
therefore you now just hide this money of yours inside ?
yes .
okay then we as sister know yourself well program we've thought that it's best for a sister that we will work with on the program we be able to give her a chance for her to open an account .
therefore we'll go and open an account for you at our expense and then you when you'll now have those monies of yours that you had you'll be saving them in your bank account so that your money can be safe .
because you do know that when you live in a house there are also many people they can get lost -- those issues are there .
and also don't make someone covet for something again you do know that ?
okay .
mm don't blame someone .
<no-speech>
therefore I don't know you on your side would you like us to open for you that account ?
yes I would like .
we feel our gift will help you to fulfill goals .
you don't you want to be a business person ?
yes .
maybe if you really decide to start working now for a whole salary of five years .
will you first stop helping in doing business of selling clothes ?
<no-speech>
it will help me .
yes it will help you .
mm .
and likewise your money will be safe the issues of second-hand clothes have passed there you get inside you take out money -- at once you've bought clothes .
if peanuts come you will have them .
yes don't you know that ?
yes .
we will help you avoid those .
just greed for little things that can that can make your money not help you later .
that is why we want you to have an account for saving your money there .
is it okay ?
