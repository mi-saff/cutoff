by Everlyne Simiyu
a conflict is continuing to bruise among leaders of Elgeyo Marakwet regarding the retirement of the former Inspector General of Police David Kimaiyo and the appointment of his successor.
a group of youths and experts defended Senator Kipchumba Murkomen (pictured) against some members of parliament that he was involved with "sacking of" Mister Kimaiyo for failing in the job.
"the retiring Inspector of Police decided by himself to retire out of the pressure from Kenyans following the rise of insecurity in the country, and it is inappropriate for some leaders to blame the senator regarding that decision," said the chairperson of Kerio youth association, Aggrey Kiptoo.
several Members of Parliament from Elgeyo/Marakwet County have threatened to ditch themselves from Jubilee coalition and blamed Mister Murkomen for "the sacking" of Mister Kimaiyo.
the members of parliament, Kangogo Bowen (East Markwet), William Kipsang (West Marakwet), Doctor James Murgor (Keiyo North), Doctor Susan Chebet (County female member of parliament), Governor Alex Tolgos and former member of parliament Francis Mutwol have pleaded with President Uhuru Kenyatta to think of filling that gap with someone from that area.
Mister Kimaiyo who retired last month, is from Elgeyo Marakwet county.
but they have claimed that Sanator Murkomen was involved in his removal from office and they want him to explain about the issue fully.
