when talking about proper nutrition we mean that the community or family or any concerned person to be able to obtain a complete meal that incorporates various foods and in short I can group those foods into five categories in order to simplify it and these groups relate to foods originating from natural grain such as maize rice sorghum and those that related to these ones there is also another which relate to foods from animals or birds .
nutrition education has not yet reached many people .
people really believe that for proper nutrition maybe you get meat or you get certain types of food .
but as I had said there are some Tanzanians who possibly get proper nutrition but for the majority of the people -- do not get proper nutrition so there is a challenge of getting all five categories of food which has become like -- it is a little bit difficult .
from various studies that have been done here in Tanzania you find many Tanzanian families get food and especially grains more often than these groups -- these other groups of -- of food .
and the problem becomes that reliance on grain foods then you will not find different sources of minerals which we call micro nutrients which are very important in the nutrition of children and adults .
the main reason that makes many Tanzanians -- fail to get proper nutrition is that first is income lack of income many people that cannot afford the five categories of food every day but another one is education because we can see in many provinces of Tanzania which have -- have been endowed with a lot of food that surround us but these people -- do not get these foods or do not use them without really knowing that the point of view in proper nutrition is looking at variety of different food groups .
that is what is basic and important and should be prioritized .
