In!

Four wins in a lot of games in spite of this, those who imported the TNT Katropa bench is still changed and ordered to be guarded!
Where can you see something like that?
The other teams will get hit and have a hard time to go up in line up but still cannot change those who import them.
But the Tropang Texters against Governor's Cup was really decided to stay in Governor's Cup at the opinion of coach Joseph Uichico because it could not be taken into Litalip in the finals, the TNT Katidtuan in the finals, and it would only be the start when they keep the expert!
Because of this, Little with the most low price of ten pages in the championship and is not the cause that he is going to undergo the boundary.
But the TNT Katidtuan in the first four games, is it not?
This success is because of these kinds of brownouts, Jayson Castro.
And if the situation will go there, the presumption of Uichico and the covetousness of the TNT Katropa bench is right.
That's why the Tropang Texters caught Mychal Ampunan, who owns the game against Blackwater Elite, memorized it.
Well, in the beginning of the game, the Elite was not able to raise the Tropang Texters against the Elite.
But this is the result of the incident that Ammie was to adjust and was not able to sleep for now when he was sick.
But in the Special Action Force, Catalro, the game of Ampunan, 109-89 in order to maintain the record of 5-0.
And Uichico is not regretful of the change he has done because he sees that Ampunan, who made 16 points and hit 18 rebounds against the Elite.
I hope you really can't regret the TNT Katropa bench because they were sent to Little Baguio.
