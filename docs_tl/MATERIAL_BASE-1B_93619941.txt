Editorials: A big challenge to ISF, Vice President Leni Robredo explained yesterday that it is not just the construction of infrastructures in order to become the solution to the problem of the Islamic Liberation Front or ISF.
Because he visited the different colors of the past housing czar, and he was weak at what he saw in the vacancy and was just pretending to be abandoned, no one wants to live.
If you will decrease, billions of pesos will be spent on this housing project, how do we do not want to sleep on the road or just to stay on a vacant job and a new job of the government?
This is also the situation of the country's housing program and ISF as well in Metro Manila and big cities.
That is why VP Leni is talking about it and they need to build a house and their heads is needed in their workplace, there are some businesses that they can attend, there are some businesses and nearby public schools that will serve as well as their children.
Even if they are homeless and ISF, they are also thinking of course the situation of their family is going to be their future, and will be given the fulfilment of their ambition and dreams for the family.
If this is the problem of a housing czar, it is sad that instead of increasing the budget of the office of VP Leni, pat it, in spite of this, the Vice President was happy to accept the higher "VP budget for the coming year 2017.
But hopefully, the "housing program is going to have a separate fund" even if it is not directly put in the office of VP Leni, many need to do this problem.
Even if others can't see the "Decongestion Program of Metro Manila or the transfer of the new community outside the city, a lot of problems like the congested traffic, traffic problem (pollution, garbage, flood) and even the crime rate.
