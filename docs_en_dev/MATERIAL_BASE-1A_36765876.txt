The wedding is dies.
Autoworks and 15.

"Your upbringing is mature today, my name is mature tomorrow it is a matter for us all if I will face us again, and you can't have any friendship with you, then I don't know how many tractors has been in one farm and I thank my host where I asked my host.

I got an answer that which is a culture of farmers of that country, every year we usually have competition to rise up because the farmers of the area may be in their fellow farm and make those competitions, they are waiting for her colleagues in getting married and so on.

It is in the Finland country, I understood that the culture started since the agricultural sector using tractors that were in the farming, happened to one farmer asked the colleague, "Jichunge.'

I will talk about the importance of social capital (social media) and the People's economy (Civil Society organizations) in order to improve the economy of one person and eventually improving the economy of the country so that the society and the country in general continue to increase the economy of the country especially the community and the country in general it needs to have this important capital.

The concept of capital on social responsibility as citizens may be new to some of us even so, it is something that we witnessed every day when we see various community groups at the end of today, we see various community groups at the end.

We take this example of the community with collaborating in a celebration, for instance, the wedding took these days to visit entertainment centers, and you met with people who are in session of organizing committee of the wedding.

The wedding committee will meet even two times in a month and when many times they meet at entertainment fields, the committee will put strategies to achieve the wedding, while other delegates of the committees are facing beer so that they will stay again as a special committee to break it, they will also be used in the wedding budget.

When our colleagues in Finland are participating in the development activities, we are together with our poverty, we are supposed to do more than a very big way, we are using millions of shillings to their wedding, but there are people who died due to lack of money to buy drugs for their diseases.

We cannot inform you by very close to the concept of community development and the society by checking the thoughts of Professor Robert Pickup, I will be in his book from the way to make the party work.
Professor Pickup, the American, gave his book in the year 1993 that he and his colleagues took research by looking for two areas in Italy, in the northern and south east and this was only 70 years since the two areas of Italy have been with economic development with no one until today.

The south east is more poor compared to the northern regions.
Professor Pickup, through the research shows that this is coming from the south of South Africa that has a culture of joining different communities in the northern region for many years have had a culture of joining the community or different African countries in general, there are many nations of people from their differences.

But the foundation of that was seen Professor Pickup, is it true that the participants in this community get out of looking for their personal interests and the community also starts and look for the interests of the whole community because of the nation, this is when I come to the concept of encouraging citizens.

Climate change is the situation of someone to realize that it is a citizen in the country and that if a citizen has a responsibility to put efforts to build his country.

Professor Pickup, and his colleagues have reduced, that the South Italy has maintained the other development because of its people to check more than private interests and those of the families living around them.

If you talk about this important information and by specialists more than this Professor, let me look at the situation as it is in our country.
For sure, for this social responsibility, we have been established and now in our community, Tanzania if the country can make steps for development to look like this wedding committee and even the burial, then it would have put the energy to look outside the family activities.

That because that procedure would have been made by the infrastructure committee in our country.
Their promise to avoid the strategies of making sure that money contributes to a result of people are encouraged to make holes on the local roads good and 'dirty water sources.
That, those should be the truth, "the local government, neighborhoods, districts, and provinces by involving citizens associated with the activities such as the construction of the nation.

And let it reach a place also, those who need to put a shame in the community can be able to put their income and even at our country's car and allow the driver to continue enjoying the vehicle for the vehicle.
The big man, when he was with his driver in his personal car, she's turned out to a motorcycle when he was unable to marry off the engines when he has begun to go and make a problem in that area he will see a problem on oil that had been planned for free.
Whoever thought about the cost of fuel from his pocket.
However, with the public vehicle, he does not have a problem with the oil, it encourages the government! Where there is lack of civilians to citizens and lack of patriotism but it is examples of those participating in development. This debate will continue.
