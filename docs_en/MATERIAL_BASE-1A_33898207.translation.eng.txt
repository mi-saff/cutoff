Member of Parliament cries to the government over farmers' security
Member of Parliament for Laikipia Jane Machira yesterday urged the government to take emergency actions to stop the rising theft of livestock in Kinamba and Ol Moran areas.
speaking after visiting those areas, she said that the campaign to retrieve illegal weapons in Baringo and Turkana County cannot succeed if the pastoralist community residing in Laikipia are left with the weapons.
"attacks have increased and I do not understand why cattle are stolen in Laikipia and taken to Baringo through Mchongoi and in one private store.
chiefs in those areas where cattle are taken must be warned or lose their jobs for failing to inform the government of these bandits," she said.
the Member of Parliament said it is a saddening thing to watch citizens dying and being hurt badly and their cattle stolen by poachers as security guards appearing to fail.
Missus Machira said that a perfect action is a must to be taken to get rid of all illegal weapons since the time has reached to save these areas from bandits whose aim is to steal and kill.
the Member of Parliament added that farmers also must be protected from these bandits and she said she is ready to involve herself with the plans of conducting a dialogue between elders from all communities residing in the boundary between Baringo and Laikipia.
currently, the government is conducting a twenty-four-hour campaign to eradicate the ownership of illegal weapons in Baringo area.
Missus Machira said the continuing attacks are showing that the operation retrieve weapons cannot succeed if Laikipia will be left behind in the campaign.
