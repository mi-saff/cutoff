the ministry of health has undertaken certification improvements and seals of yellow fever vaccines.
minister of health, community development, gender, elderly and children, Ummy Mwalimu has launched certificates and new seals for yellow fever vaccines.
Ummy said the delivery of the vaccine of the disease in the country is facing the challenge of the presence of some dishonest citizens who are faking vaccination certificates and giving them to travelers without being vaccinated.
and that in order to eradicate the deception, it has decided to upgrade the old certificates by placing hidden marks.
"as a result of technological changes, old certificates have been easy to be made by the conmen and given without vaccination. therefore, the ministry has made improvements on certificates of vaccination of yellow fever by putting secret marks and making new seals," he said.
he said the yellow fever disease is dangerous because it has no cure and that the government has seen it fit to protect the travelers, especially that the World's Health Organization recently reported the outbreak of the epidemic.
"if you remember in late March 2016, I gave a warning of yellow fever due to the report of the presence of the disease in neighboring countries of Kenya, Angola and the DRC," he added.
"recently, the World's Health Organization gave a report on the outbreak of the epidemic that began in December 2015 and resulted in the death of 377 people and 4,347 patients in Angola while in DRC 121 people lost their lives.
