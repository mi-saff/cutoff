<no-speech>
if you hear about a hotel it's their cooking .
<no-speech>
now a restaurant like this or you think I'm not getting its name right .
a chef is not a chef if .
most of the time they have managed to preserve the taste of the food .
<no-speech>
the taste of their food does not change .
<no-speech>
the food you ate today if you eat it tomorrow the taste is the same .
<no-speech>
it is different from other restaurants that you can eat food and find it tasting differently and tomorrow you eat the food and its taste is otherwise .
but the second likewise is the hygiene of the food itself .
<no-speech>
hence as you currently know there are various disease outbreaks .
<no-speech>
when preparing food for your clients the food should be clean and good .
<no-speech>
you guarantee safety in their stomachs so that they don't get food that they later spend a lot on treatment .
the issue is not about the price the issue is someone's health .
people are currently cautious of health .
to eat quality food not to contact contagious diseases .
