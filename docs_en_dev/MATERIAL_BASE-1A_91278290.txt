How are this news today?
They don't have a word that mother is safe and it's also repeat the mother to be safe and also it is also safe for small, I have also been looking for information that I did not know as a mother mother Elizabeth Masawe.
In a lot of life, it was a lot of surprise, when we go to Dar es Salaam, we're close to cold and coldness.
But at the time he is going to school to the school, welcome him from the school because it takes a very few hours when you go through one hour and a half hours and when he was called a phone with the office if they are still not registered.
Because they have told them that there is a problem with me when I told me.
There are things they want to make sure that there is a very important program, that day you have modified the same way.
Usually, do not inform you, why should you fall down?
Because I was not a girl.
And he told me they were unable to know where problems are affecting the phone, the late does not say so that is why you are unable to know why should it be remembered?
They were told to go to the go tomorrow.
Almighty God say I will let me say that I will also give me that production that she will not tell me what they will do justice and now the late God bless you, which will take place, I will take the same day.
Tomorrow, the Almighty God do not have sure that I am looking for what I look for hours to come out, I tell me what I will go back to live in a few hours in the morning.
And it is also a bit or little, it is a very beautiful lady.
I want to think about my mother trying, I hope that I do not tire us so and now you know what you look at television or you are doing what you look at television or you are doing what to end.
May the late God prepared himself to be careful.
And now he loves us, the late God loves our health in Tanzania Women's Health, so other than the wave, you know you like you.
Absolom went to me, the late God, but you shouldn't know what I am looking at home but I don't see me when I will go back to Syria because the late does not go through you today, the late God is.
When we get in Dar es Salaam city, I will be known as ten o'clock in the recent hours, I'm very happy to welcome me if I will get the Lord.
It is to ask you and ask you, if he would like to know if I would like to know or that I had bought it more, we will just be the late.
And why you have talked about it is if he is not annoyed instead I don't return to the organization is to have joy.
It is seen.
If it is a call, I am very happy that I have no thing to maintain this time and those events you know, I have written.
However, I don't end up so that you will give you a long time to be handed over, the same time will welcome me when I register me, then I get very much and let me see then there are other things I want.
There are others that I can help them and then the Lord, let me look at how I will look for these hours, I want to know what I come at, I believe that I come at the end of this time, I know that we come at the same time, I know that we come at the same time.
Same as the Almighty God rest his five minutes, then I will start looking for me, then the late.
When we live in Dar es Salaam city, I would like to ask you, we have heard that I met and I believe I have written I met here and I believe that there are some manners to what we met with the church where most of them are still unknown.
No they were going right is the soul of keys.
Professor.
The late God is not one who is believed to be the late Almighty God, which is not my same as she was carrying one feet.
I did not lie!
To look for justice because the late God rest my dear friend I don't see why we are looking for pneumonia, then I think I'm in the same time when I think I am happy with you.
We will look for the Almighty God bless us to tell me what I have talked about words that I have been asked here, even when I'm in Dar es Salaam, I am not the husband to welcome him even if it is not the husband to welcome him even if it is not the husband or not her.
I ask you recently, then the words will come even the questions I request for many questions, even I have finished seven questions, then give you.
What happens up to anyone did not know the ones that you feel like the ones in the market and we see the late God is what your friend and abusive language is very delicious.
You are not aware of your vision and vision or not in your opinion, all the words of what is like the late God is not say God is happy about him.
When we get in Dar es Salaam city, we will be careful, and also you thank us to know that it's not Shein what does not allow me to use abusive language as it was not bad.
But it gives women you have a lot of men a very old man it was like that he did not think about normal questions like as the one that was affected by gospel musicians to welcome him as a red carpet.
