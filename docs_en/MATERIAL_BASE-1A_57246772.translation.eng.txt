may I tell you, that I have found the one who comforts my heart?
I am 22 years old.
there is a young man who we have been lovers even though I don't love him much.
now, I have found another, who I love with all my heart and we plan to get married.
do I tell that first one or do I leave him? through SMS it will be good you tell him that, you've found the flower of your heart so that he stops wasting his time on you because he still loves you.
it is clear that that will hurt him in the heart, but he can hurt even more to hear you are married and you never told him that you found another.
the one of old wants me again, there is a man who we were lovers with, for four years and we had one baby together, even though he left me when I was pregnant with that child.
I have found another, who wants to marry me as the second wife and we love each other very much.
now the father of the baby wants us to reconcile.
advise me.
the condition that the man left at a time when you needed him most having his pregnancy, is a sign that you can't trust him to be your support in times of difficulty.
I have found another, I was married and we got one child.
that child died and after the burial, we disagreed with my husband.
later, he married another wife, but she too they have disagreed.
now my husband wants us to reconcile while already I have found a lover and we love each other very much.
what do I do? through SMS, that will depend on your feeling to him, he cannot claim that you are his wife because he left you and married another.
if you don't want him again and you have decided to be married by another, tell him openly that it's not possible.
