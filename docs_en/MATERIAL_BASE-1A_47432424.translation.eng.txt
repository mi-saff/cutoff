in-laws quarrel a drunkard, a tormentor of their sister.
this kind of spectacle has happened in this area when a drunk man was found in a bar with his in-laws who beat him up badly, claiming that he had married a lady whom he loved from nearby village and with whom he went to school four years ago.
"even though that lady was strongly warned against marrying the drunkard who was known for his addiction to excessive drinking, the lady totally refused to listen to her family members and asked them to cease interfering with her personal life," said our reporter.
their marriage had been peaceful for a while without any complication since their union.
moreover that couple had been blessed with one son.
however, things changed two years ago.
for unknown reasons, their home became a theater of confrontations every time.
according to the reporter, sometimes those confrontations sparked a war within that couple.
however, things got out of hand one grim day when their impasse turned into a fierce battle between them.
"it was during this war, when a man threw his wife breaking her hand," explained the reporter.
it was after this war, that the woman packed up her belongings and returned to her parents and her brothers took her to hospital for treatment.
this event angered her brothers who decided to search for the man whom they intended to teach a lesson for intimidating their sister.
since the man is a drunkard, they found him within a very short time in one club drinking alcohol and confronted him.
"so, after trying to kill our sister have you come here to celebrate?"
one of them fumed."
"today you will discover that she has people who are able to protect her," he said.
together, they began to beat him up mercilessly regardless of being at a public place.
however, the man was rescued by customers who intervened and urged the brothers to leave him alone.
