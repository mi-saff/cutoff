We were impressed by a bird who was Samuel Dolas a lot.

You are Samuel Guerrero.
Celso Mandez Junior, NPA-Sorsogon.
December 8, 2014.

We strongly condemned the murder of armed forces of the government to Samuel Dolas in Barangay Lapinig, Gubat, Sorsogon due to the body of the victim that was buried today at the side of the road in the nearby Barangay Skakel and Bacon District, Sorsogon City.

According to December 4, Dolar was missing in December 4, while the arrest by the combined forces of the PNP Public Safety Company and the 31st Infantry Battalion of the Philippine Army in the said place, according to the witnesses, Dolar was walking home when he was beaten by the soldiers.
Dollente went to the former stronghold of the NPA who has long passed away from service and has been working as a helper in our knowledge, which is the only reason for killing the government troops that was the only reason for killing the troops of the government.

It is just right to deny the tragic fate of Dolor in the hands of the government troops that he is a civilian and the killing of him is against all the law about human rights and inhumane.

We encourage the relatives of Dolly in order not to keep quiet and put in fear to the authorities in order to insist on justice for the victim so they make sure that the criminals will make a step to hold the perpetrators in this crime.
