Ummy Mwalimu and advice to men.
Dodoma, we believe that there is a good advice from the minister of health, community development, gender, elderly and children, Ummy Mwalimu.
If you listen to Ummy is his sentence has banned men to walk or have a love relationship with women.
Same, let me see what happened in parliament and especially the statements from this leader about the love.
It's right now, "men do not play with female children who are studying and instead of his issues we do in the estates there are many women."
I don't know if the local women will agree with this mother's statement, because it is like he is getting a fox which is hunger.
But on the second side, some of the women can see a happy issue to them, because the students will have been fined. "
How would you know what's when it's found?
