The executive director of Kilombero District Council in Songea district, Somba, has instructed the Chief Physician in that council, Doctor Mustafa Panju's inspection from time to time in bookshops and private schools so as to identify the shops that sell government drugs.

Moreover, he has urged them to ban all shops that will be known to sell drugs that were allocated time and take action against those owners so as to stop the habit of those businessmen who are cooperating with workers of the health department to steal drugs for the government.
The teacher has given that order while inspecting different types of drugs that were removed by the health department, that will be spread on the clinic and health centers together with renovation of a special system of medicine at the Ikungi Health Center.
According to the health department has a legal responsibility to ensure that every owner of the medicine shop is focusing on the law, regulations and procedures that are there by selling correct drugs for the use of human rights and to avoid selling drugs that are supposed to be used in the clinic, health centers and the government hospitals.
He said that the step will help to save the lives of citizens who are a big economic pillar, because of good health there is no job of production that can be done, something that is dangerous to the economy of the council.
He said that some of the owners of the shops have a dirty game to sell drugs that were given its own time, an issue that can contribute to poverty since the citizens buy those drugs being unable to agree and cause a citizen to use another amount of money to buy medicine which could be able to take them to other services.
The chief medical officer of that council, Doctor Mustafa Panju said for now he is proud to see in the clinic and all the health centers in the northern region there is no huge shortage of drugs.
The Mufindi District Council has 14 health centers, 10 and four institutions of religious institutions together with three health centers, among them two vocational stations and Ndeki.
