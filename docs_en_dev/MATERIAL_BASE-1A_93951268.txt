Putting it just and the fight against ten and two that are expected to start tomorrow, while speaking to the press in the city when they have made the journey of Oscar Pistorius has said they have given three million shillings to help those competitions to succeed.
Being there as a gift of groups together with research, we said that maybe he has been claiming that the competition is for the purpose of paying for this game that was being supported by the secretary general of the National Association of Tanzania when they were supporting her sister, Rodrigo Londono.
How he saw the head of the heads that are spreading it and spreading it and said that if you like a game they will get to the game.
Events that play but invest in Mboni or international environment will get a boxer.
It is leading to lead.
I want to get the seats that may go for the money to help us have a big challenge.

But we are looking for the commercial business.
Also, the problem is the cost of running our party right now it has no ability to take the game in schools in a big sun like we talk in the video.
And in the fight.
For starting, but we were still continuing until now there are five hundred thousand players in Dar es Salaam but our goals have been of more than one children.
