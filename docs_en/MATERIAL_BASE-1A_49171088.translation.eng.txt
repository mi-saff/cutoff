Minister of Information, Culture, Arts and Sports, Nape Nnauye has praised the efforts made towards the fixation of the artificial turf at the old stadium of Nyamagana, here in the province.
speaking during the assessment of the stadium, Nape requested the contractors to do their best in the construction of the stadium, to ensure it becomes the best in East Africa.
Nape said the government will continue to support the construction of the stadium while requesting various investors such as the banks and pension funds to assist in the laying of platforms and seats in the stadium.
"I congratulate Kagera and Mwanza councils for constructing Kaitaba and Nyamagana stadiums and I'm requesting other municipalities and councils to follow that example by constructing other stadiums," says Nape.
Minister Nape requested the international teams to come and play at the stadium because they have camps in this province for them to use.
Assistant Mayor of Mwanza, Bhiku Kotecha said he really applauds the government for its efforts of constructing the stadium and promised to follow the instructions given to him by Minister Nape to ensure they finish that stadium.
Kotecha requested the minister to grace the launch day of the stadium once completed.
