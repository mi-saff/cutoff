Youth miss using pregnant women, a child.

It has been written by Hanscana.

I was heard of 16th October, 2016.

How many things do I get there, I urge all stakeholders before continuing to write what I wanted to give my son who introduced himself by the name Mercy in his sudden death.

According to Mercy, her lover on her biological mother (the mother to the girl), Mercy also, she is pregnant in our community but it's the real situation, relatives, "said mother and child.
When he released him, Mercy explains that, the person who gets and believe that she is able to thank you in a prestigious tournament and even refusing to destroy the parents of her child (10) of Palestine by recognizing the talent of that child and continued.
I commend so that it is not many parents especially Tanzania who are doing efforts to identify their children's talents and some of them know but there is no efforts to promote football.
Lionel Messi is a soccer player of Argentina, and he has been the best player of the world, five times and they seen the video showing off the child's talent without doubt that they have qualified to play soccer and his colleagues, but no one was forced to prevent him.
The one taking them as how he has the great ability to own football, attacking and discriminating each other, and great ability to follow the goal.
Juventus Club has criticized the talent of that child and already it has signed, thus after several years he will start doing his work on Infrastructure, in Italy.
Maybe there are children of Tanzanian children with different talents but it is proud that, parents including youths do not want to know and to develop them.
Children's talents is a must for them and if they are continued, they can use them next years to get money such that happened in Messi, scientists, Christiano Ronaldo, Karav Dhingra and musician Janeth Jackson on a good day.
