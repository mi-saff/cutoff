TFF continues open the regulations of the competition.
Last week, the issue of Simba player, Novastus Lufunga was taken a chance in the news headlines after the police soccer team got an appeal after that team brought together in the list though he has a red card.
The police got the appeal by Simba for what took him that beating Maccabi Tel Aviv in the Federation Cup last week in that game, Simba won 2-0 goals.
In his appeal, police wanted it to be victory because of Simba's step to put the jersey of the player.
However, TFF has thrown out the police force because it did not meet the criteria because it did not have 300,000 shillings that are supposed to be accompanied by appeal.
However, together with TFF to raise us from that appeal, there have been various complaints on law, regulations and procedures of the competition on what is explained as a big part of the FA Cup, will be supervised by the premier league regulations.
Basically, what is required is for TFF to make policies that will make every competition to be independent because they have its procedure.
However, some of the regulations shows that there is some areas that will go to each other.
Regulations of the FA Cup will be different from the premier league so as to eliminate the controversy that would be able to come out.
A good example is the regulations of the FA Cup, together with the use of the premier league, the FA Cup is complete and it is a must there are areas where there are there.
We think it is good for TFF through its technical committee to look at how to build the regulations for every competition because the position is and it is possible to do that.
Likewise, as a result of one regulations for different competitions, there is a problem.
A good example is the round of 16 (2) which says, the competition of the Confederation Cup of Azam Sports 5 will be led by these regulations as well as the policies of the league in VPL, FDL and shoes.
The TFF Electoral Committee will have the responsibility of through the government to discuss and give a decision on all the few events that arise every round according to the regulations of this competition and the league (VPL) FDL and shoes) they are inspiring.
Another area has confirmed that the competition of the Football Federation of Azam Sports 5 is the knockout stage, the use of the league rules to participate in the knockout stage in the knockout stage.
This is one weaknesses of the regulations, because the premier league does not have the knockout stage.
Another problem is the regulations that were given out of the FA Cup which is not a section that gives a red card to be red or yellow fever.
As a result of a lot of mix up, that is why we request TFF to have regulations of every competition and it should be open early before the concerned games start, every club is supposed to understand and be keen on them.
But this event should be a lesson so that it is not for Simba and TFF only, but other clubs in the premier league or participating in the competitions with an official procedure to have several units in the club.
If there could have memories, the issue of Lufunga would have been an opportunity to the leaders of Simba, TFF and everyone wanted to know and it would have come from causing complaints.
