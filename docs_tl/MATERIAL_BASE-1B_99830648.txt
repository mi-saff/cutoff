Press: Butch Abad back to the PSC.
By Al G. Mendoza July 1, 2016.
In the return of Butch Ramirez, as chief of the Philippine Sports Commission (PSC), expect the meaningful changes in sports.
If in the past the PSC is almost leaning on PAGCOR when it comes to its funds every year, Butch's strategy is different.
Aside from PAGCOR, Butch Abad pointed at the private sector to support the accident of the accident and Elite sports and it is also not new but the private companies, especially the private companies, will increase even more.
Although PAGCOR has a big contribution to the PSC, "there is much more lacking.
It is expensive to search for a new gift for the countryside and it is more expensive especially for the lowering of our homes, food and using sports in our athletes and coaches.
The PSC is in good hands especially with Ramon Fernandez, a column that is not only in basketball but to the leadership of the direction of his co-worker, Ramon and Shane.

Butch is lucky for her.
Also with Charles Sol Aragones, as a former sports chief of SunStar Davao, his knowledge in sports has vast knowledge.
If Ramon and Charles were personally known, there were foreigners to me, Fatima and Arnold Agustin, but because of the adversary of Butch, let us expect that the two are okay.
With the leadership of Butch, our athletes seems to be fair tomorrow.
