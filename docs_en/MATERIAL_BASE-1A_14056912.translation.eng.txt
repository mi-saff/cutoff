Emmanuel Reuben is an executive general secretary of the party .
he says that the ladies who does the work of selling their bodies look at them in three colleges .
my call from the government and different well-wishers people who are watching this program is that we have a challenge of tools .
is that the machines are few in comparison to the project we had asked because the project was like the first everything once that you succeed because I had gotten it from the ladies .
therefore we have lack of tools because machines that we had are five or four machines .
then for twenty ladies it still becomes difficult but not just them .
still others who were abandoned are children in the estates need to be taught higher mathematics we are targeting the ladies among the age of fifteen to twenty-five now these ladies with twenty in Tanzania you find a certain place is a mother and family but had already undergone .
especially them also we feel that when the projects expands we get a person to help us with tools like tailoring machines events and together with material cloths to help many women (()) .
therefore my call to the government and the different well-wishers is to look for ways to help those ladies to form a nation that is good good generation because those children that are being given birth to by these ladies are those will later turn to become reliable in government .
if you consider these children many of these ones are not going to school till they are taken to school because mother does not have the ability of taking them to even nursery class one itself is costly .
therefore you will make a bad foundation .
therefore whoever have the ability all to be able to help this station we welcome you to come and help .
