Children of the countries of that country came in their normal class in Kenya, the late Adam and then.
Let's end.
When you go to Dar es Salaam, you will be given a service to us for us to have the ones that we met after their work.
When we live in Dar es Salaam, we have agreed to talk a few words which is for the parents we get in, we get to meet with what the players are.
The late God, because there is a parent when there was no one when she lost their capital or the late God and we are not playing.
If we are told a certain man he does not know?
Now we want to meet with the parents we are doing and we need more to meet the late God because it's difficult, we want to participate together with a person who does not know why we want to participate together with the person who don't know, therefore, we want to participate in the areas they were many and they were found.
I would be able to get back to the late.
It is good therefore, but just the same time you want to meet the parents to look for parents to come up even when you know what I want to do, when you know what you want to do when you want to see you.
Ras Kiduku was not true?
The children's meeting will also be in the fourth month, whereby we are going to school for the same insurance insurance.
Now it is a must for parents to know that they can be able to change him and know what happens.
The witches and also, we are looking at that province it is true that I gave them a lot of money even if it is not a lot of money but that will be.
When you get in Dar es Salaam, I'll give a new girl in the funeral, while you have given a photocopy.
.
The late God is saying that and now it has said that it has already organized itself in accordance with very disturbing, he has organized itself from three o'clock until five hours when it will be donations.
We have not heard that, but there is a meeting that he is doing, P-Fi at night and I think it would be able to explain if you were in Dar es Salaam, I would have explained if the leaders of what are in the church, the late God said that he does not say starting.
Starting from the third month, the late God was three thirty o'clock and a half hours.
Then later.
Then people are confirmed.
How's the Church involved in five o'clock in the world.
When you are now I don't know how to come out this number even if you start to announce that now we have to talk about because there are these children who come alone.
And those who are coming with the parents are currently in Dar es Salaam, we have a different groups to get their photos and they are coming with their parents and they are coming at any time when I don't come at any time when I don't come up because they are coming from five and a half hours like you are known.
Doors, it has been closed if the fire has been closed down.
We will have me feel much, we have forgotten that this year's two years like that, the pastor said that you will enable you to live in five hours such as we continue to go even if I will be able to go even if I will be able to go even if I will go back early, then I will go back to avoid soak.
Now six hours the late people who like to sleep I go back to sleep at the end of God, but it is difficult to sleep she is difficult to sleep.
So much is not difficult for the others to miss.
When I've heard of who you look for this news here and enjoying anything?
I ask you like he has heard that they will be entering a two hours from the same time, I used them from six o'clock in the next seven hours I will make sure he will make another service, he is planning to stay in a program.
If he will plan that he will make sure that you have been closed down, so they will be able to get back in my friend but maybe he will get a letter from him as they go down there.
The late God, but now it is not like that maybe they are going back later he will have the right to welcome him, the Almighty God cannot end there and there will be another service after that step will be from recently until ten o'clock if it will be a service.
I don't know if there will be Christopher?
