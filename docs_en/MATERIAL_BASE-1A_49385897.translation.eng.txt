"these upcoming artists are after fame in a wrong way by maligning people, he had requested Rose to be part of his video and that is why they met for the discussion and she was accompanied by younger sibling, where does the guest house issue come in there?" said Maliki.
he added that "if I didn't know that and how it all was I could have left my fiancé whom I love very dearly, but what that artist did is not right, because he requested Rose to take a photo with him without knowledge of his intentions".
Maliki said that the artist is seeking fame by maligning people's names, something that is out of order in the society.
