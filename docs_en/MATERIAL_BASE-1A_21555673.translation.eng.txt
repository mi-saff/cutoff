slum dwellers enjoy good scores
Likii slum dwellers in Nanyuki, celebrated after two students from the town obtained 417 and 416 marks in the KCPE.
happy songs spread in the slum known for smelling alcohol residents praising Lucy Muthoni who scored 417 and Hamza Githae, who scored 416.
the students said it was due to hard work in the studies and neglected the environment they came from out that made them successful.
Muthoni was studying Saint Christopher's primary school and Githae was studying at Saint Moses's school in Nanyuki.
their parents were so excited that their children made the slum a great deal of pride and would not be despised by the city again.
