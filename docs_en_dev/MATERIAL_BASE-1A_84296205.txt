Brightiles 24, 2016 by Msangamkuu and Mlabu all.

Last Sunday, the President of the United Republic of Tanzania, Doctor John Magufuli made the appointment of chairperson of the board of directors of the Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA), Bernard Mchomvu, together with that chairman, the whole board of TRA is also captured.

This step came when there is a rumor that the income of revenue is not well in TRA, reports indicate that the government's revenue have already started, contrary to the information offered by the government being good because the growth of the economy is good.

The report depending on the appointment of EATV and his hand with the board marking a discussion in various parts, especially in social media networks are questioning the state of revenue that is good and TRA has been proud of the goals, changes are what to do?

Rumors of the debate gets more strength because it is not the procedure of President Magufuli to give information and reasons for taking any decision that he will take. But by any reason, the board did not have been released soon, there is no reason what is going on in TRA?

When the announcement of having that TRA board has been issued on Sunday, something that led by many security there are security there or it is a must to have a lot in eternal life and now the leaders get you and to look for human beings especially what is going on there.

Your password!

The reresult of the board of TRA is being seen by many in the context of the state of issues that changed since President Magufuli came to power, where he has taken a lot of action of blocking misuse and sealed loopholes of evading taxes.

We remember marking a huge conflict between those who were revealed for thousands of containers admitted at the port without paying taxes as the president wanted the business people that were involved in paying taxes and that was able to pay taxes so that they can pay taxes so as to prevent the collection of tax collection.

On the second side of the fifth term government of President Magufuli that it has taken a stern action of blocking the expenditure in government, this step is believed that it has affected the private sector which has been depending on the government as a new customer of its services.

Among the steps of preventing diseases which are causing to fall in the private sector is the haphazard use of public funds through the workshop, meetings, meetings, meetings, these celebrations will see those funds were able to go a private sector.

There are business reports in the private sector to leave, especially those that were depending on the government through some media houses have reported that some of the entrepreneurs have lost their money they had promised to pray for loans including fields and buildings.

While hundreds of buildings and plots have been sold to remove the debts of loans, many people have also changed the life of life, now people has reduced and drinking water, and added that drinking water and misappropriations.

The government says that every person cannot change their income and there is no longer depending on the deal of in town, the reports indicate that some of the entrepreneurs have found themselves due to their businesses to be able to pay the loans they received from the bank and other financial institutions.

Already, one bank has been closed down or the reports show that the benefits of another bank has reduced, and this bad state of the private sector has a relationship with a surprise of TRA heading to his board.

On the internet, the debate is going on but the biggest thing is the feelings of maybe recently, maybe if it is one of the social network Forum (Magufuli) where things are not allowed to check up because your leaders are unable to look for you immediately, that is why she knows how things are not working. "

Another person wrote, "this is a very few person, I have never seen a leader that is usually hanged when this is now like TRA is crossing the goals that he can resolve the board?

Another suspect says, "the work to choose and rule that he will do that until now, then you come back again, then you will make sure that every month will help them to pay taxes so that many people could be able to pay taxes, so they can also be the chairperson of CCM who has no even profession."

One of the growth of one of said, "Kashgar, the data to be buried and we have told them every day he had discovered that music he didn't like to hear and they did not change their music but they also increase their voice but there are no revenue.

Another citizen said, "I was supposed to sit down from now I don't know what since I don't know what happens if you don't see the courage and put on him when he was told, they don't have the money that he was told.
