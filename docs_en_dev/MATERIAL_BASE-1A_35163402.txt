In Dar es Salaam city, there are those who know the cause of their vehicles due to the huge cargo of used them, and especially the price of fuel which is continuing to rise, while the income is continuing to reduce.
Some of them can enter into a prayerful person to buy electricity at a easy price in the streets when its quality has already been reduced, after the retailers were reduced, they do not pollute the fuel and thus being dangerous to the engines.
During the economic situation if it seems to be difficult, we expect many of us, who see the strategy of the government to make changes have affected, the Citizen newspaper that's a solution to enable you continue using your car in those environments.
Experts who speaking with our reporter have explained several reasons for enabling the user to avoid using a lot of oil when he had been running and thus getting for the burden on oil prices.
Walk at a queue.
He said the lecturer of the National Institute of Transportation, Engineer Michael Kyando.
Kyando said the queue is one of the biggest reasons that make oil is used for large numbers and therefore it is important for people to walk when there are no many vehicles.
He said apart from using a large extent, vehicles also use a lot of oil in the queue.
He said that it is important to prevent the air conditioning the queue so as to care for oil, "if there is a big foundation of vehicles that have already been responsible for the purpose of producing oil and vehicle if the queue are using and downloading easily.
The opinions like that were made by a new driver not that she uses his car in Buguruni in Dar es Salaam city, Issa Minister Sheke who is keen in using oil to ensure he gets benefits.
"C is something what I look for, because it is using a lot of oil when you look at the queue.
For a long journey, use air strikes among fuel got a lot of costs in the queue.
Engineer Kyando said that it is clear that the wind being filled inside and there were found behind and therefore causing a car to use more strength to move forward, something that causes of using a lot of oil.
Many drivers are supposed to leave it open during the long journey, believing that without a wind without a habit of crude oil according to the loss of drivers to run a high speed without any reason and to take over the oil without a procedure.
"You will increase the speed at the trap while talking to procedures according to the needs of your car in the same time," said Hussein Khalfan, executive director of Aubameyang.
He said that the competition of competitions use many fuel due to drivers to step in oil for violence in order to ensure they are using a short time, "vehicles which can use many fuel to the whole air," he said and I advise the drivers to step in oil according to the journey continuing instead of over the violence.
He said in the areas if you're not known, the driver has no need to step in oil and care for the car, they also said to care for the car, which is together with working on a huge use of oil.
"The producer or the owner is supposed to do a car to look at every period that was approved by a kilometer, he is supposed to change the weather because if the weather did not affect the disaster," said Engineer Kyando.
Khalfan said that inspection from time in order to make a vehicle used to use a lot of oil.
"Due to the engines that use abusive language (oxygen levels, it is important to inspect low oxygen levels, air travel which can be self-employed and cause a car that runs a car (clean water is very important).
Said Khalfan.
He said that in the past vehicles that were used to be known as modern, are using Hulk from which it is good to deal with the problem of the use of oil, but it is also important in dealing with the problem of the wind power which causes a lot of resources to move ahead, "said Engineer Kyando.
"There is a car that is mentioned on the wind power, without being expelled and the vehicle for the vehicle by preventing myself if it has been forced to use great strength to move forward and therefore using a lot of oil."
Cargo on the sun will also cause a vehicle using great strength to walk and thus using a lot of oil.
Also, they also increase the oil until it was finished, another reason that makes a car to use many fuel without a reason.
