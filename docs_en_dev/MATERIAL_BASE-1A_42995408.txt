That appeal has been canceled by the lawyers of the government who are Paul Kadyage and Matandu Tsehai said that the appeal that was taken by the lawyers of Lema has not met the legal requirements because those lawyers got appeal instead of showing the intention to appeal.
Materu district said that they have presented their objection in the front of Judge Fatma Mashuari the Supreme Court not to listen to the high court because his lawyers joined Lema, who are Peter Kibatala and Shangani areas after announcing the intention to be heard in that appeal.
"We have today we have put the petition to be heard in this case because our colleagues have gone against them instead of presenting the appeal to appeal and the law did not state so that it is the first to show the intention of getting an appeal," explained Materu.
Therefore the objection for the intention to appeal will be presented in a short time tomorrow November 30th, this year at 2 o'clock in the morning, the government's side will discuss the argument of those lawyers in the same day, and the judge of Lema will identify those lawyers in the afternoon.
Then the chief justice wants the decision against the petition on December 2nd this year, and if he will agree with the government's side, Lema will have failed and if Lema will win against the government's objection because the primary case was heard and given a decision.
