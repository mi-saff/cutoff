The hands of the Marcos regime was bloody and his hands were bloody at the 80th IB, Philippine Army when they were killed by the victim's house in front of the victim's house in front of his wife.

This is a desperate step of the regime and his armed forces in the military to silence their rights in the entire island as a part of their own efforts in the entire island, and was also active in front of his own efforts in the entire island, and was also active in front of his own efforts in the entire island, and was also active in a state of human rights while the other victims of the state of the state against his citizens.

We are confident that the culprits will not be held accountable and there are still many cases of violation of human rights that can be achieved by the local citizens and the National Democratic Front of the Philippines-MLM and the armed forces of the New People's Army or NPA.

Long live the CPP-MLM for the 25th anniversary of this!

Long live the CPP-NPA-NDF!

Long live the noblest Filipino!
