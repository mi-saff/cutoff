Riadha Tanzania (RT) has urged regional parties to do elections fast so that they can participate in the national elections held in December this year.
the acting RT Secretary General, Ombeni Zavalla said yesterday that the regions should make their own timely elections so that they can get the legitimacy of participation in the General Elections.
Zavalla said that until now its federal party has its own election reports of the Singida and Arusha regions, whoa have submitted the names of their elected leaders.
he stressed that any region that would not succeed in its election before December would not have the right to send representatives to the general election meeting.
in addition, Zavalla said that the RT Executive Committee meeting was expected to be held at the Filbert Bayi Sports Complex Mkuza, Kibaha in Coast on October 22, which, together with other matters, will discuss in detail the electoral date and the venue.
he said the regions to achieve their elections were the success of the RT general election to get new leaders.
at the same time, the National Sports Council (BMT) and RT session scheduled for today has been postponed until this month, as stated.
Acting Secretary General of the BMT, Mohamed Kiganja said yesterday that the session was postponed after RT leadership requested to be done in line with what the Executive Committee would do on October 22.
