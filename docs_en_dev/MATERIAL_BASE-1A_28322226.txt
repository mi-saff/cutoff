Do not understand what we believe in Brazil?
Jon 09 / 2014.

The World Cup tournament will end on July 13th last year in the tournament which has a lot of celebrations and sexual violence here and there.

Every time it happened after four years the soccer lovers of soccer all over the world, all the eyes have been following the big soccer competitions in the world where it occurred.

The competition of this year has had challenges of here and there are many challenges not have been witnessed and even the ones that are not expected to make sure we have witnessed players with great names unable to do because many do not have names as compared to the expectations.

For African teams we have witnessed, there is conflicts and conflicts with other players of those teams going back to camp even before their team was released in that tournament.

But also Algeria's team have been able to put history by being the first team from Africa to get a large number of goals when it defeated the South Korea for a total of 4-2 in the group stages.

At all times there is some of the coaches who decided to release their level as a result of their teams doing badly.

Perhaps those who put it to be after presenting their report, there are no problem, they will continue more than its obligations after getting the results against their promise.

In the quarter-finals towards the semi-finals, there are several events that have emerged as together with getting the striker of Brazil, Neymar, who is for sure that they received the soccer fans in Brazil due to how he is depending on.

The defender of Colombia, Juan Zuniga scored, who represented Neymar, came out to the press while asking for forgiveness for what happened while insisting that it was not his intention to thank the player but it was in the process of serving his nation, considering that the world cup in the world.

Perhaps, what I heard Zuniga scored, doing that is after seeing the issue of Neymar, has been a talk in every corner of the streets of Brazil.

However, the analysis of soccer issues, if he knows that action that involves throwing Stadium saying it's a few players that they can do so.

Those are some of the few events that happened in the competition, there is a need for us to ask ourselves what we have learned in that competition.

Normally, we have been the ability to follow different things and especially the ones that are from outside the country and this habit, especially through different groups including our artists who every time it does not have our culture but even if it does not be found without knowing them.

Our soccer players here in the country and other soccer stakeholders, after checking these competitions, it must know that there is a need to learn.

For our coaches who have been set aside, they should realize that resignation is normal in soccer and especially when your team is unable to achieve goals.

But also, the issue of discipline for players is a very important thing because even those players from Ghana were taken back to home before their team was released in that tournament, they have shown acts of misconduct that is not allowed to be found.

Cameroon who was eliminated from different accusations of having done a strike on the excuse of getting into that tournament without being paid for their money.

This is another shame for the African team, if the player can appeal to show his level in big competitions like that, claiming that it has not been paid an issue to be followed but it is not a high speed.

After this competition there is need for stakeholders, soccer leaders and even our players, first to continue to witness this competition but also to learn anything that can help improve our soccer as a result of the challenges that were witnessed in those competitions.

I don't know if there is a person who will be able to understand the act of Lius Suarez, for seeing him a fellow player but by imitating stars of some players like Lionel Messi, who have decided to show clean football while they will serve their nation as required.

However, I don't have sure that there are our players here in the country that will face the habit of going in Makonde, as she is divided into Cameroon after being defeated.

The World Cup tournament will be a catalyst to the development of soccer in our country so that we can be able to follow keenly what is the shivered to the players.
