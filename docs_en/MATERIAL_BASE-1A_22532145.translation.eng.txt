only 10 people attended
the hit maker of the new single hold my hand of D-Knob today has amplified, the reasons of tying a knot quietly in year 2009 while the total of those people who attended together with the couple which was not more than 10 people from the church up to where they were going from the church.
"I wanted to do it with my partner, I told him we have been lovers but now it is needful for us to be in marriage, he said let us go we led each other to the church, the priest said you cannot marry each other, you do you know what marriage is?"
there is a step
it is not something that we wanted to do like a lot of people so that you start contribution because all my close friends are broke, I would not want to tie a knot and then at the end of the day to be mad at each other that this one did not contribute or that one contributed, the second one I wanted to do it so that I can continue with my life the way someone decides to celebrate his birthday.
'our parents got the news lastly because even the old man in his message because we sat on the same table after the wedding the old man said, I don't know which gift to give you because you told me yesterday, the thing that we successful got was my wife's gown because it is a very expensive gown, I thank God it gave us stress in the beginning but it was successful'.
