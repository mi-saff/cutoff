Toggenburg - the best type of dairy goat
this is a type of dairy goat whose origin is Switzerland in the area of Obertoggenburg as it is called, this is the oldest dairy goat.
here in Tanzania they are found in Uyole, SUA and Tengeru (all of which are veterinary colleges)
production
these goats are capable of producing an average of two liters of milk a day or more, not as much milk as Saanen except their milk contains between 3% - 4% fat
nature
these goats have an average size but are larger than a traditional goat, 55 kilograms per female and 75 kilograms per male, have brown (khaki) brown until brown
they also have two lines on their face color of milk or white from top to the nose (like duma) have big udder and are also parents and good caregivers, often able to produce twins
weather
these goats are not able to withstand hot temperatures, but they do well in cold areas like regions of Mbeya, Iringa, Ruvuma, Njombe, Dodoma, Singida and so on they need sufficient food to give more milk, and the food has a full supplement.
although they can also be reared in areas of drought and they could do well (good foragers)
character
these goats live in escaping groups or enter the crop field so they all go and learn it very easily this makes it easy to teach them to be milked by a machine
