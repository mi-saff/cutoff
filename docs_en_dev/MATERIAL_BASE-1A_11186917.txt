The sacred heart of free is not same as stopping for free because when walking for him may be coughing, in that context, the Swahili language also answered that spread and thrown out the disaster.

These sayings means that they are involved in many times he gets a lot of differences with someone who does not depend on well as something, this week has touched me to give our youth a lesson so that when we start the year they can help them in front of the journey.
This column has never been able to write about the concept of natural gas to some youths during their studies in various levels of education that the loans are available for the purpose of parents or guardians and others take action to boycott the school like to study for them is for the benefit of parents or guardians.
The truth is that it is easy for your life and your family that we shall begin and not otherwise, the following issue can create light on these things, at the end of the week at the city of Dar es Salaam when I got stuck on this incident.
I was surprised by a story that he gets with my neighbor I would like to listen to her ideas from neighboring countries of Kenya, found themselves having to take action and to live in a good house in Nairobi, found themselves having to take action that they did not expect their old child.
According to his coupon, during that life, the young man was getting all services to the parents and he too was told the news of some work he refuses to ask for the claims that he is not good.
Finally, he was born with 35 years old and therefore his parents gave birth to a house to live a house of home where those new children got their first child and later they get all their services to their parents and later to get even a car for the purpose of their private transport and their families.
Here I would like to remind of the famous news that you are saying, "the child said when his family continues to expand and its parents still live in great houses, therefore, they should live a small house for a servant.
According to his webpage, that's when his father was trying and made a step that he did is for a good house for six months and gave them that during the period they will build a big house together with the sleeping house and then they will come back to the houses to live.
For instance, a young man decided that if he said, his father in the same period will be forced to reduce their use of her child and make them continue being dependent on everything before the period of six months, the father will sell his house and moving to another place without their youth to know.
When it came back to their house, he found himself with another house and remain open mouthed.
The one who passed is a cry and grind using the teeth.
This story is an important example to the youths who are due to the authority and the power of their parents usually found themselves like they have positions and power like that.
There are some of the directors, heads of provinces and district and even big business people who have not seen that they don't have a need to look for their lives because they have not seen them to have power and those properties as they get their parents.
They think that they don't have a need to register themselves in their property, this is an unusual thing and the youth don't have to change this. It is possible that we should leave each other.
