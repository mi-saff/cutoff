"Like what Senator (Antonio Trillanes IV said, that it is possible for you to get up with what you have said," it's not true, "it's not true," it's not true, "it's not true," it's not true that I really have a holes, "said de Lima with Dayan.
Despite this, the former secretary of the Department of Justice (DOJ) to Dayan and Espinosa were not conducting a cross examination because of his belief that their testimony might be changed to clean his name.
"It would have been good to cross each other, but thank you, you know that you might be attracted to me, you might still fix the line of mine that you are lying," said De Lima.
"By Ronnie who is also like Ronnie that's why I can talk to cross the two, you will go out of your lies," the lady senator stated.
