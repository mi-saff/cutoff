On first of May, it will rise up on foundations of accountability.
Employees of Tanzania, today they join their colleagues in the whole world in the celebrations of May first which is used to speak and make an evaluation of success and challenges that face the implementation of their responsibilities.
The source of this day that started since the 19th century of America and spread in Europe and then in the whole world is the staff to oppose the long time of work and wanted to have a right to join the workers, they were forced to work for many hours until now up to 20.
Employers complained about the interest of workers and even their working environment to an extent that many lost their lives with a small age because of the diseases that was caused by poor environment at work.
The first party of the workers was made up of 1827, Philadelphia city, America, and its main responsibility was to cause a special period of work hard to continue the process of that region and when it reached in Baltimore City America, to form the federation that is called National Labor Union.
Three years later, he was called a international meeting for employees in Switzerland and there was made an international conference for employees of 1891, another international meeting was held in Paris, France and the one claimed to be on May first will be released as the World Workers Day.
Since there, the claims of the short-day work was controlled and even the solution is available, it came out a lot of things including shivered, and therefore wanting the existence of changes in the system so that the employees of controlling the high level of accountability.
The history of May first is long but it will not be heard of us that the claims by the complaints by workers are for many years ago and have also take a new chapter as every one challenge is given solutions.
For example, the natural challenge that was given to May first of time to work, although there is still a problem to several countries especially the ones that are ongoing in the world, to a large extent, it should be resolved by the servants who understand their term of work and to the institutions that its work needs a staff for a long time or all of them, there is turn back.
The biggest challenge in which has been a cry for many years and it is for the interests and now there are recommendations that the least being paid 750,000 shillings in a month.
But there is also other challenges as a good environment of work especially considering that sometimes a good price is not everything to the employee because there are organizations or institutions that it has dropped due to the environment that it has dropped from that environment.
That is why we celebrate this day with a history of alleged to have rights to employees, we are supposed to say that we will go hand in hand with the responsibility of us employees from the public until the private sector we are supposed to ask each other for her time, we are fulfilling our responsibility as required?
If we should tell you or there are weaknesses, we take this step.
We believe that we have been so much, we will follow keenly the steps of economic development and the interest of employers and the employees will be considered.
