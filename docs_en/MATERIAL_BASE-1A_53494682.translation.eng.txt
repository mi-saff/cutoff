teenagers die taking 'selfie' in front of a train in Delhi
the ordeal was reported in the local media
two teenagers died while they were taking photos on a railway in the Indian capital Delhi.
a group of teenagers went to the railway station to take selfie in front of an oncoming train.
but two delayed to leave the railway and the train crashed them, the police said.
a study last year has shown that many deaths have been attributed to people taking selfies in Indians than any other country.
academics from Carnegie Mellon University and Indraprastha Communications Institute in Delhi say that among the 127 deaths of people taking selfie between 2014 and 2015, 76 cases are reported in India.
a recent event has been reported after the media in the area reported on Tuesday.
"during the photo session, they saw the train coming they moved aside.
but another train appeared on the other side and were stranded in the middle.
they were hit by one of the trains," the Indian Express quoted a police officer.
one railway officer has added that the teenagers hired a professional photographer for the job.
"we have found the used camera from the teenagers.
it had photos and videos, the video is being scanned, while those pictures prove that they were jumping from one railway to the other," Deputy police commissioner Parwaiz Ahmed told Hindustan Times.
last year two students drowned as they were taking selfies in a flooded river in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh.
and police in Mumbai have mentioned 15 areas where 'it is dangerous' to take a selfie after an 18-year-old girl drowned in the sea while taking a selfie.
