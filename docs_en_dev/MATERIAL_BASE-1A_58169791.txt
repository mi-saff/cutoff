We are waiting for the budget with a dividend of 6 shillings.

Next week, on Thursday, June 14th, Minister of Finance, Doctor William Mgimwa, is expected to present the national budget for the financial year 2012 / 2013.
This will be the seventh budget since President Jakaya Kikwete entered to power in the year 2005.
It will be a budget where it comes two weeks before President Kikwete went to power according to the constitution of the United Republic of Tanzania.
But this will be the second budget for the second term of President Kikwete.
In all the past six budget, as usual there have been existence of success and problems that can only be contributed in the management of those budget.
It is possible, challenges or stability in the management of the previous budget has been contributed for a certain way and ministers of the concerned funds or even some of the government officials and sponsors of those budget.
It is our expectations that, the weaknesses in the first six budget will be used as a class to learn and strengthen this seven budget which will be the first budget for the new Minister of Finance, Doctor William Mgimwa.
But on the other side, the strength of the previous budget in some of the areas of implementation will be used as a criterion to continue improving this budget.
It is our expectations, this budget will give a lot of problems that are not economic growth in the country.
Most of the biggest thing is that, we are expecting this budget to put better strategies of controlling the inflation rate of important products in the country, that is, it will be a budget for citizens.
On the other side, we expected this budget to look for advice from the executive council of the Revolutionary Party (CCM) to enable the value-added tax (VAT) to be withdrawn from food.
More than that, we are expecting a budget to look for another advice of interests to the nation from other political parties and other private institutions in the country, basically, we are expecting a budget with great benefits about the problems that are affecting our country's economy.
