Morogoro Provincial Commissioner Doctor Stephen Kebwe has invited Simba soccer teams and Yanga to use the National Stadium in Morogoro after being prevented by the government to use the National Stadium in Dar es Salaam.

The Minister of Information, Culture, Arts and Sports, Nape Nnauye the day before yesterday announced to ban the old teams to use the National Stadium due to its fans on infrastructure of the stadium including breaking up seats in the premier league match that brought together the rocks at the end of last week.
Doctor Kebwe said that when he spoke to leaders of Morogoro Football Association (MRFA), the leadership of the Jamhuri Stadium and the players of Morogoro Police Team together with their leaders after the completion of the game of the First Division League match against Njombe town the day before yesterday at the stadium.
That Provincial Commissioner said he is supporting the decision by the minister Nape to prevent those teams with many fans to use that stadium.
"National Stadium has been built by our friends of China by using huge costs that are tax for citizens, while Yanga and Simba have taken a loss to the government and because they don't have a chance again to use that stadium, because there is no seats that can be able to use it," said Doctor Kebwe.
Therefore, he wanted the leadership of the Jamhuri Stadium to start producing a huge renovation of infrastructure and other sports areas so as to meet the modern standards for the national and international games.
I give three months to the leaders of this stadium to start a modern renovation starting from the sports areas, white football, hands and netball teams while at the same standards, Yanga and Simba should come out to play for the Jamhuri Stadium, "said Doctor Kebwe.
In addition, Doctor Kebwe thanked Morogoro Police Team for starting well in the First Division League competition in his group urged them to put effort and knowledge on the instructions of their teachers so as to play well in the following games that are inside and outside the province.
"I would like to see Morogoro Police team is competing in the Premier League with the government's government and various foreign stakeholders and outside they have shown their energy to support this team so as to play the premier league next season," said Doctor Kebwe.
He said in order to grow the soccer game and others, it is good for the leadership of the stadium to take action of renovating different areas for the purpose of being used in the premier league and urged the players come out to play in the premier league and urged the players come out to play in the premier league and urged the players come out to play in the Premier League.
