today the Maridhawa journal focuses on the concept of livestock cooperatives that is not very much mentioned despite the fact that it exists and is still working in various parts of the country .
and to start off let's get a little definition on this concept from the cooperatives officer at the office of the Provincial Commissioner for Arusha Mister Peter Lasuai .
the goal especially of to -- to starting these societies is that -- I think that they will help them in their livestock .
with a particular focus that we ensure that they initiate the projects that they have livestock we ensure that whether on the side of the Maasai -- Maasai land that they have many livestock but their benefit -- they do not get the benefits .
let's say like year -- the past years they were faced with the challenge of weather and livestock died .
and it favored that we start those societies so as to issue a procedure for them after they have been in the society it means they can -- some of the livestock they can sell and be able to take care of other issues either by buying food and helping these children -- their children to go to school .
