They are heard the late I am surprised when I saw them.
The coming games.
When you play in Dar es Salaam, I wish to watch the funeral of yesterday night was not seen.
At night, the late God bless you did not see there was football yesterday night and we should see me.
What is the team?
The late queen of Sheke Ahenkora has been fed a cake together with the late God bless you, in Dar es Salaam, I went to play for football from seven o'clock at night.
At seven o'clock at night like the late God bless TANZANIA, I cannot stay up until now I see the ball, I can't know what I cannot get, but when you get the results up to this time when they see how many times you are, even how many times they do, even if they get the team.
What's a team that does it mean to you are and you have wanted you to know because anything done I told me or I saw your responsibilities, to know the way we are in Dar es Salaam.
When I think I did not see the late God bless you so that I do not meet her fan of football, Ras Kiduku was not very delicious with me, but even so, you know that you're very attractive, but even so, it is good, I cannot sit and give birth to Kenya.
Their friend of humor, but Kenya too.
The late God bless you with the attack against fans is a must.
