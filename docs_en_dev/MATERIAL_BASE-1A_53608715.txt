Kiganja wants the TFF to change.

January 13th, 2017.

The secretary general of the National Sports Council (BMT) has wanted the Tanzania Football Federation (TFF) to change and stop using a lot of time to discuss the issues of the coach that they will stop instead of discussing how they can help the development of Tanzania soccer.
That issue has been looking at many stakeholders because the federation officers have been discussing the tax issues of the former coach of the national team Charles Mkwasa, instead of let you know the plans they have through the national team to take it to the national team.
He said that TFF should stop continuing to discuss the reports of the coach who was left out and instead he has urged them to follow up on the right way of running the Tanzania soccer and eventually do well at international levels.
He said that most of the leaders have been running things very much and they do not like to work on fanaticism that make Tanzania soccer to be below as days will continue to move forward.
I don't see if there is a need to see the media and be able to pay a coach because there is no benefits in the world of sports because there is no importance in the world of sports because there is no issue that will be able to learn political leaders for more than to continue growing conflicts, "said Kiganja.
On his part, Lucas Mpongole said that TFF has been able to talk about the salary issue of Mkwasa and to stop important issues of players conflicts and to look for a solution to the problem that bothers leaders.
He said there are many cases that were taken by various clubs to complain about their rights but TFF have been trying to do their problems and make them get rid of their rights as a result of following their rights for a long time.
He added that the issue of paying that salary Mkwasa was a secret of two sides, therefore there was no any reason for TFF to open those issues, an issue that makes them lose time in doing many primary things.
Mkwasa has denied the signing of his contract with TFF a few days ago while his contract has lost three months to coach the national team and his position was taken by a long coach, Salum Mayanga, who has played 74 matches.
