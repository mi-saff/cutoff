in any kind of life there is success which doesn't miss challenges .
<no-speech>
but from the period that he said my brother Superman Simbe that that period that's when I was chief of communications .
there are many things that I did but I beg to say about two things which I believe even if I say it people who know the police force well will agree with me .
one it's true that first the police force in the country under I_G_P Mwema had emphasized that there is no success without communication .
<no-speech>
therefore my challenge is that what is the chief of communications coming to do for the work to be successful in the force .
of the police .
<no-speech>
but now as a result of the plans of the police force and the country in general %incomplete
and let's remember that the moment I just got at the headquarters it the was the start of the preparations for the two thousand and ten general elections .
<no-speech>
and the ruling party's C_C_M's declaration had said towards general election the communication should have reached the ward level .
<no-speech>
okay .
and when the government makes such orders it means every department and every concerned operative is making efforts to reach the stadium as they said .
now this thing reached in time .
when I say that Superman understands because our communications were ending mostly at the provinces .
of all levels .
<no-speech>
three big radio communication (()) .
<no-speech>
there are direct communications in which you can speak to someone even outside the country by just using the mast up there .
<no-speech>
but there are communications of short wavelengths through which you can closely communicate with someone .
but if you also want to communicate with a person from far you must put something in between called a repeater .
<no-speech>
now at the time I was getting into the headquarters these repeaters were only in the provinces .
therefore they were not in the districts .
<no-speech>
but I thank God that it was possible through a major cooperation of the police force and some assistance from U_N_D_P and cooperating with the electoral commission .
<no-speech>
we got communication that is accessible even at the wards up to this day .
and even if there is a place that lacks it right now maybe these are new provinces or districts that were started and I don't know how they are doing .
<no-speech>
