We can do: Those desire for the New Year.
He was able to explain to 30, 2016 two days only in 2017, and due to the opening of another New Year, this is the time for us to go back to this person in order to see the important experiences in our lives and the important things we learned.

If there are things that are important, let us look back from the year 2016, this is their lessons to better improve our lives.
Next year, one of my dreams should prevail and peace in our country should prevail, especially that there are many innocent children who are involved here, especially since there are many innocent children who are involved in our country and we believe that the death penalty would be stopped because we believe that each person has the ability to change their lives.
Another thing I wish for the New Year is that the important promises of our government will push through with the end of this year, including the free treatment of the poor in the hospitals that will be implemented by the Department of Health (DOH) and the giving of free education for every Filipino to be implemented, 2017 for every Filipino.

For the end, hopefully in the New Year, we should not visit and damage big accidents like the typhoon that seems to be growing every year, many of our countrymen continue to rise from the turmoil of some typhoon that passed us this 2016.
Before the New Year arrives, we allocate time with our family and loved ones in order to give thanks to our Lord for the past years and pray that peace will prevail in the entire Philippines and the lives of every Filipino continue to prevail.
A happy and happy New Year to all of you!
