Bad behavior of parents affect the growth of the children.
One student once told me that she desires to have a look at Swahili films, because they don't have ethics but he is unable to fulfill his dream because the neighbors and some of his brothers get married.
"Teacher I wish you so much my children to look at this film, one day he was sent to my son and asked me what's the meaning of a child.
I told him that his meaning is a child, my son refuses and said that why the artist has gotten her the artist, baby Boy? "You have narrated it.
If a parent should be required to control the use of communication agencies because they can destroy the specialist doctors, the ones that are used well have a great contribution in the development of the church.
There are children's programs that involve the mental children and ethics, so much to have Swahili or other foreign languages, the ones who are supposed to be given great opportunity instead of programs that are not less than to help any child.
We are also parents who have won home at the end of the week then children don't have joy and our work is to look for news reports from Al-Jazeera who had been arrested, BBC, CNN and other international channel.
If you finish news, we are participating in the England Premier League, and we are finishing up on the slaughterhouse, but also those children are supposed to be given an opportunity to view these children and considering that many children of children are in the last days of the week.
Your habit of complaining and insisted that the 'control' and denying them your children to view that station is developing the behavior of the fish and not to cooperate with others.
If you have also been supported by your young children, that a big man comes, when he was told the name to manage television until it will expire.
Also, this issue can provide the loopholes to your children to move to the neighbors where he can learn such behaviors.
Recently, we have witnessed the presence of a behavior that involve Ukakasi 'by behavior which have been problems in the streets and home.
Unfortunately, there is no one who wanted to know what the source of those bad behavior that are being done by their youth, most of the parents have reached an interview about the movements of their youth without knowing that action can deal with that problem.
Also, there are parents who have the responsibility of proper upbringing of them and decided to fulfill our children, these are the parents who thank their male youths that they are seen and when they register themselves, to stop the disco hall, to put up or pay.
The truth is that there is a big relationship between the success of the child and his behavior in general, this is the fact that most of the parents are not aware or they do not understand.
Experience shows that students who do well in school have been caused by upbringing that consider the ethics of their parents and the community that surrounds them.
The drop in the level of education especially to the primary schools has been contributed by the upbringing of parents on their children.
Right now we are witnessing on a big level, most of the class seven students will start without knowing how to read and write.
In addition to that there are other reasons that contribute to that situation to drop the success of children, but parents can't finish up with that problem.
The biggest reason that contribute to bad development of child is absenteeism in plenty, the problem of absenteeism are facing students whose parents do not have time to follow up closely on the development of their child.
I would like to ask one of the teachers in Mwanza town, where many parents come to school to stop immediately to ask for the development of their children?
"There are parents who come, but it's a very few who don't know the 10, in a total of more than the 400 children we have here, even if you are being involved in the sessions of many schools?
He told me.
About the good behavior of success and success in class, this teachers is continuing to say, "in the whole period of my service like teachers, I have witnessed many students who do well are those with good behavior and those who are doing evil deeds for them.
His motion is supported by another teachers from Hai District who believe that we become a close to the students whose parents follow up on the development of their children and provide close partnership to the teachers. "
