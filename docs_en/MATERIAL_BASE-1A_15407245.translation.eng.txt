Obama strives to close Venezuela's Guantanamo Bay prison with restrictions
Washington, USA White House is about to reach its goal of closing the Guantanamo Bay military prison, which has been used to detain terrorists.
and while President Barack Obama has been committed to accelerating the closing process, analysts say he may not be able to close it while in power.
last week, six prisoners were transferred to other areas after being released from the prison.
the six, including four Syrians, a Palestinian and a Tunisian were transferred to Uruguay after serving 13-year prison term.
the move results in the number of prisoners released this year to 19, 13 of them being transferred in a period of one month.
"our position on the prison is due to its activities threatening nationalist security and should be closed," said Patrick Ventrel, a spokesperson for the Security Council.
"US citizens should not be spending hundreds of millions of dollars every year for an institution that affects our relationship with the countries that are our main allies," he said.
Washington, The United States Congress of the United States passed a law that promotes strong restrictions against Venezuela officials linked to human rights violations.
this step is ironical considering that United States is on fire for torturing of terrorist suspects.
the leaders are involved in the support of attacks against protesters who were against the government earlier this year.
thousands of activists were arrested while more than 43 were killed during the protests against President Nicholas Maduro's government, who was elected to replace the late Hugo Chavez.
the protests lasted from Feb to May.
the United States announced traffic disputes against officials in July.
the failure of that rule to make changes in government is the fact that there has been an increase in those obstacles
