The south regions have all reputation of being a special region of economy.
The southern region of Tanzania includes the provinces of Lindi and Mtwara provinces which for many years, it was behind development due to a bad state of infrastructure especially the road.
For the year 1990 and going back to the past, it was not important to use more than two seasons for air travel for the journey from Dar es Salaam to Lindi or Mtwara, at the moment it is a speed of six to seven hours.
That situation was caused by poor conditions of the road and the absence of a bridge that is evident in that river was very small to an extent that for the government servants who were transferred to provinces they viewed as a result of their employers.
For the recent years, especially from the year 2000, Lindi and Mtwara provinces, it has been a great attraction for the purpose of living with investment in the agricultural sector, industries and business.
We're starting from different provinces in the country, they have been moving to a fast rate in this provinces, from entering the agricultural, livestock and business activities.
In this period that the government has set a lot of commitment to build the economy of industries it is good to look at how it can use opportunities available in this area.
South Africa has all reputation and opportunity to carry the image of the economy of our nation in our nation.
Those things are not in the provinces of Lindi and Mtwara, it has a great land that will not be used in production activities.
Land of the South provinces do not have conflicts and to be available in economic activities.
The presence of great land and natural fertility is enough, we are estimated to be an attraction for modern farming, livestock and construction of industries to process agriculture and livestock.
Another opportunity is the Mtwara port which has a lot of natural gas at the Mtwara port is enough opportunity for the importation of natural resources from Mtwara and also transportation of products going outside the country.
It can be used as a fast rate for industries from this provinces and also lead to various natural resources.
Mtwara port has a big area that can be used for the purpose of expansion and construction of infrastructure to improve infrastructure.
Natural gas is another opportunity to assure you the source of reliable energy for the use of big industries, small and homes and also more than natural gas which is affecting the country through the port of Mtwara.
It is easy to attract investors to come and start industries in the provinces of Lindi and Mtwara, where that is where the natural gas can produce electricity for the purpose of industries.
It is also a way to be able to revive and build other industries for illegal immigrants so as to increase value instead of being sold with crude oil in the country.
Another opportunity for this provinces is the production of wild animals, doughing and sunflower and the production of these crops is an enough amount of starting of industries to buy fish, and decided to buy oil and sunflower.
Farmers can be able to be sensitized more than sunflower and air crafts and then to make sure he affects the reliable market and a good price of those crops.
It is easy to save small industries in Lindi, Mtwara and Tunduru District than to start building new industries in those regions or other provinces in the country.
Advance yourself in Lindi and Mtwara provinces, it knows the neighboring country of Mozambique which has good relations with Tanzania and therefore the industrial products that will be produced in this provinces will get a good market in the northern regions of Mozambique.
On that logic, then it is clear that this provinces has all the opportunity to be done to be the special region of industries in Tanzania.
It will be surprising thing if the government will continue to attract investors to continue building industries in Dar es Salaam city while the south regions are all the opportunities of Dar es Salaam.
The residents of South Africa are supposed to take this economic opportunities.
