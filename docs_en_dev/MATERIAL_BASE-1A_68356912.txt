Our brain, and without keys has gotten lost by 15 percent.

"Do not be sold and who had gone against him in Karume Stadium, then died.
'No one should not be afraid but I think our fans last, and keys have cheated. "Those are some of the statements not to take them to the ears of the country.
When you get to that statement, you can end laughing out unfortunately, she didn't jump.
But you took the time I had previously previously, you can make sure he joins those people.
Recently in a normal environment, how can I explain anything "of the Olympic Committee to fill in many delegates of the sportsmen during the convoy of our representatives in the Olympic championships this Thursday, in London City, here in England.
When our colleagues have come back to several medals, Ugandans have been proud of on the gold medals, we have continued to keep in line with the reputation of our website.
But you thought that we have been bad to our participation in the Olympic Committee that you have written, then you came to the Holy Quran, "Deputy speaker of parliament, Honorable Job Ndugai, explained to ensure that some of their representatives in parliament (members of parliament) have been getting into the party's sessions to make laws against alcohol and small businesses.
Before we have done various reports to discuss this report, it is good we remind one another that in accordance with the recent changes, the honorable members of parliament are paid 11 million shillings per month and we discuss these people to have an understanding that together with the poverty of our country, we decided to give them honorable interests.
In a certain way I commend the deputy speaker Ndugai for very happy about the question that I think many citizens have been asked, "why are many honorable members who want to change parliament" and there are many members who like to change parliament as a place of sleeping.
Some of us we see the pictures of that kind so as to send himself the hope that maybe the honorable ambassadors do not think about how to serve their voters, and maybe the country in general, with great success, "likewise, the decision to sign him are looking for a position of participation of Bongo Star Search, by her talent.
It's true but that is the fact that some of the honorable members use the opportunity to contribute to the argument of showing their competence of bidding farewell, mocking him and even discourage them.
But what I saw in Ndugai, "the foolish thing is that, (I am an albino)" members of parliament are people like other people, but there are many people who are not similar to each other, so that many people do not affect the Tanzanian?
Ndugai (not right) to claim that the members of parliament are going on in parliament to understand that they get such a human being, "I am not allowed to enter the class when I understood.
Then for a bit tricky subject is true that the deputy speaker was understand that there are members of parliament who engage in parliamentary sessions, but he did not get any action but he is waiting for up to get a chance to place this matter in an interview with television station.
This is a good leader so if we can thank you for "we can congratulate you for" what is happening in parliament, but the bond he was given is not a cry for the toes (the reason to be noted that there is a series of people who are untaxed.
And it's not like I has used the word "criminals" by bad luck and a person that is paid 11 million shillings as a salary of owning a citizen, then he decided to do a lot of things ("A and drug abuse), and he does not have a difference.
It is a teaser that causes people to live in problem so as to avoid their interests according to the expectations that those rights will bring success in work but he also wants to implement its responsibilities while he is not beneficial to the head "(not given)!
In one of my articles in the past, I put it open that my stand that big salaries on the extent of our parliamentarians is robbery in few days (in the picture) because it did not qualify for some members of the parliament and their responsibilities, and to stop in parliament.
But there is a primary question that every Tanzanian is supposed to ask you.
"It was.
One reader of this magazine, Omary Abdallah, a Tanzanian that lives in Germany, did not use a message through Facebook network, he advised that instead of continuing to look for religious leaders, we need us to elect leaders who are not supposed to choose leaders not to be taxed.
In a short time, the reader insisted that Taifa has been faced with fraud and criticism that concern them from the parliamentary campaigns.
But also in accordance with the problem of alcohol addicted in some of the members of parliament, the income of those members are among the factors that want to inform their responsibilities.
In a normal environment, a person trying to get a lot of money more than his needs can be able to do very difficult things, because of them, there are a lot of millions of money, but there are a big amount of money that is as a result of their normal needs.
The issue of murder to members of parliament is seen as seen by the public, while doctors and teachers were told the government does not have money to improve poverty and environment of their work, we have already been given reasons for increasing the salaries of members of parliament who already had big salaries at all.
The performance of many of them don't know and even a little of you, they could be given before those salaries for our parliamentarians are cash, most of them are poor people in Tanzania.
Now, because we consider the member of parliament that you have a better way to maintain the wealth, then we will expect to see our elections in front of involving each type of wealth, then we shall see among those who want to be part of "the wealth of the wealth of Manchester United Kingdom.
In the normal state, who does not want to be paid though several thousand shillings only for sleeping, there are two three teams in head because it is like to go to the bar and then be paid easily.
I request that it should be understood that it is not every member of parliament because there is a few agents who know their responsibilities while some of them have taken off from the speaker of parliament because of violating the ethics of the parliament.
The few heroes have a lot of courage because they are given out of fulfilling their responsibilities, are witnessing some of the people who are left to continue with those sessions as a result of drinking alcohol or attractive things.
How do I start by going back to the questions I have written in the beginning of this article, we have shaken me, or our mind, then I request it to give him but your answer should be in a box for votes in the next elections.
Where there is a will there is a must.
