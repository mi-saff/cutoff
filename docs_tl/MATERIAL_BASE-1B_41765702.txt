Pass through sports.

These past few days, the feelings of the Filipinos are too much about basketball when there are many who went here to the Philippines, international basketball, and they are all united in the contribution shown by the Filipino fans in basketball.
Even the fight of UST and La Salle University became emotional and almost all of the viewers, that is why our belief is getting better, which is why it is getting better that there is a big thing to have a calling sports.
I was even a councilor for a councilor, I asked for the Sports Complex in QC.
It's not just basketball who can make peace in the Philippines and boxing which is leading, the number of people that we are hiding in this field.
Billiards, we have a lot of stars.
We can also take head of water sports and let us show the beauty of the beach in the country.
There are still a lot of places in the Philippines with good destination and perhaps a big help is already a big help for us to show sympathy and help for the improvement of tourism in the country.
Tourism in the Philippines has a big potential, especially if the famous athletes are going to use, especially because the story of the lives of our athletes is good and it is true that it can be an inspiration to anyone.
Hopefully the government should take advantage of the fame of some of our sports utility vehicles to attract many interest and many attention in the Philippines.
If Pacman has won a senator in America, just think of what he can do to the country if he will talk, and athletes like him, in the whole world about the beauty of our beloved country and encourage the other race to go to our country in their plans to go to the tourists.
