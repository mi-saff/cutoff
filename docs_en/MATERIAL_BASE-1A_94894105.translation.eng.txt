a mother raising a family of 7 blind people, Mwajuma Nasoro (66) a resident of Simbani in Kibaha district at the coast is in the process of requesting for a 60,000 shillings assistance for the purpose of taking her grandchild Majid Maulid, who is in class two at the Irente Primary School for the blind that is in the Tanga province.
speaking to this newspaper at her home here in the city, she said that the school her grandchild attends is expected to close at the end of December this year and that she has been the one taking him to and from school.
she said that since June this year, an arrangement was set for parents or guardians to bring and take their children while in the previous years they were transported by their teachers bringing and taking them once school was closed.
'I have begun an early request for people who are able to help since we do not have the ability and we have been asking for contributions from various people for the fare to take him," said Mwajuma.
she said the situation is very difficult as there are times they find themselves having only one meal due to the real situation as it is, whereby they have had a life of chance as a result of not having any special activity.
"we depend on the burning and selling of charcoal together with weaving mats which help us in getting income and cash for food for my family," said Mwajuma.
in addition, Laila Nassoro, the child's mother, who also is blind said that when the time comes for bringing or taking him to their school it's a great challenge because they depend on begging people to contribute to get the funds.
she said her son is doing well educationally because last year he led the class by being number one and in the sixth month this year he held the second position, something that gives them comfort that he could become the savior of the family.
