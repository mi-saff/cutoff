When you get in Dar es Salaam, I'll give the ten opinion to the late?
You have a views where he went to I went for plenty, I was able to escape the late.
He was a patient and then I went back to another where he told him.
If our country's songs, the words of you told Shinyanga he does not know it and we will see what I will go to here, the judgment of the person started now to tell me another one, the situation he told me as one of them.
Same, we will speak then and peace and I asked me, let me see if he told her as' Imebaki Story.'
You miss.
