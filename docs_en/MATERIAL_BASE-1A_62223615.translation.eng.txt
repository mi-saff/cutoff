the communication network for all (UCSAF) wants the mobile company in the country (TTCL) to change its system of communication from CDMA to GSM.
that step is to simplify the availability of communication to citizens of the villages that are in the park of Ngerengere, Morogoro that uses the company's tower that is in Tununguu Sub-county.
the CDMA communication system denies the user's ability in deciding to choose different kinds of mobile and agree to use only one type of mobile that allows the system, instead of GSM that is used to any kind of mobile.
chairman of the board of that fund, Doctor Joseph Kilongola, said the package has provided funding subsidies to that company to enable to build that tower for the purpose of giving the citizens who live in that place an opportunity to get the communication.
he said it would be meaningful as the system used by that company is affecting those citizens tin getting the communication and that is not the purpose of the government.
"place like this TTCL thinking now about the rabidly change of their communication so that the citizens can benefit with the fruit of UCSAF" he said.
the contact tower of TTCL in the Tununguo sub-county, Morogoro distributes communication to the villages of Dete, Mbogo, Kisanga Stendi an Tununguo.
board members of the fund there are in tour inspection projects for the contact towers located in the counties of Tununguo, Chakwale, Chanjale, Chagongwe, Mandege, Doma and Lyogwe that exists in various district in the Morogoro region to see the performance of that tower that is donated subsidies with UCSAF.
