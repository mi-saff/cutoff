What we want is to remove CCM only.
Brightiles 19, 2015.

If I have promised in the last article, this week is continuing with my analysis about the general elections that is expected to take place on October 25th this year.
And if it was in the previous years, my analysis will expire in the race for the presidential position.
During the last article I discussed opportunities and restrictions to the candidates, "two heads, that is Doctor John Magufuli of CCM and Edward Lowassa of parliament of UKAWA which this week I will get in details, with the aim being to use this article to do the analysis of one candidate, and this next week it will help him in another candidate.
Let me start by the member of parliament of UKAWA which is between the last article and this is not a secret that the news that is called "floods, Lowassa said all activities that brought together the presidency in Dar es Salaam up to meeting being introduced in Mbeya, Arusha, and Mwanza.
A large number of people who are coming out in the activities that involve Lowassa, should be by demonstrations or attend the meetings, it has given many followers that the way of the former prime minister heading to the State House is white.
In line with those big attendance, several members of CCM have left that ruling party and joined CCM members, but the most important is to relocate for some leaders "who had names" inside CCM.
That the demonstrations and the rallies and the meetings are urging many people to be very much, that does not have a debate and that events to donate that politician will continue to fill in people also, that there are members and more leaders of CCM they see Lowassa that we will also be discussed.
We want to conclude by the sure this time is if you came into the same time because some of the members of CCM and their leaders follow it and we will be interpreted as well in the next general elections in October 25th, approximately two months from now.
Despite the presence of great efforts, about the register of the voters' book that has been improved and technology of controlling the computer system (Bihagaze (UDART), until this time the National Electoral Commission has not given a full number of people who registered themselves.
Despite that, already there are signs of errors in the issue of BVR puts several names of who registered themselves not to see their names while the size of the problem is not yet known because the National Electoral Commission (NEC) has shown an explanation on that issue.
Here I will deal with those two issues in the world, that is a big number of people who are coming out in Lowassa's activities and the exercise to register it.
What you want to conclude that in large numbers of people who are coming out in the activities of that politician, should have its benefit from his party in general, then the first one of those people, if it is not all, you must be able to vote.
But for the experience we have many, register themselves as one issue, to succeed in another issue, to succeed in another issue, and asking him to vote in another candidate and that vote will help him in another whole issue.
I have not talked about my previous articles as one of the great benefits to CCM is a relationship of reviewing between them and various public institutions, and we are expecting many brothers, my brothers, I have heard of your fellow party members to be assisted by the ruling party to be assisted by the public institutions "Masau boasted.
Although all times the accusations have continued to remain being the allegations, first evidence is heading to signing those allegations.
Private, I have been following up in the general elections through the internet, especially in social media networks (social media) recently, I warned fans of Lowassa about their joy that are derived from the danger of the audience of the public activities that involve the politician.
I saw them about the previous elections, especially "speed by Augustine Mnonga (Mrema)," the former presidential candidate in the year 1995, through the NCCR-Revolutions Party, how he used to be popular and filling a certificate for people in his meetings, but he finished by CCM's candidate, Benjamin Mkapa.
I saw us also about the large numbers of people who came out in the campaign meetings by Doctor Darius Mans, who was the presidential candidate on the CCM ticket in the last general elections, in the year 2010, but the candidate of CCM, Jakaya Kikwete.
