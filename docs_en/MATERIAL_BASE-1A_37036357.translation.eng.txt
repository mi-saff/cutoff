a total of 75 cyclists from both in and outside the country are expecting to participate in the open competition of the so-called "Mountain Bike" competition that will be held from November 5 to 6 this year.
some of these cyclists from Kenya, Uganda and South Africa have already begun to arrive here to participate in the tournament as well as members from the local regions, including Tanga, Dar es Salaam, Kilimanjaro and Manyara and the host Arusha.
the coordinator of the Arusha Cycling Club (ACC), Mosses Andrew said yesterday the competition will be about 65 kilometers on the first day and the second day 52 kilometers.
"to this end, preparations for the race are going well and this time we have got external participants, we have Faith the race to be competitive as some regions we have sent invitations will come and how much this response has been for this year different from last year," said Andrew.
he appealed to the Government to allocate special features for the development of the game in the country from the regional level because without doing so the game is in danger of being lost with many stakeholders who love the game.
the competition has been organized by ACC, which is held annually this being the second year since its launch, aimed at developing and upgrading the game's new talents.
various prizes will be provided including cash money where the first winner will receive Sh 200,000, second win Sh 150,000, third 110,000, fourth 70,000 and fifth 50,000.
