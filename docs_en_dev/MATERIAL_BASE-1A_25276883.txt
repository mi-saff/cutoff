Members who are not faithful are dangerous for the development of the party.
Followers of CCM participating in the launch of the general election campaign in the Jangwani Arena in Dar es Salaam last year.
One of the ways that has brought success in any matter so that the existence of faith in those involved deal with this issue is to make sure.
Human beings who becomes a contribution in the community to bring development is a must to have five important things among those things are skills, truth, rights and integrity.
A person having those five things can enjoy the counting, she is a person who has been completed and he can give progress to development in his community.
When a person gets these things, the issue of bringing development even to him, it will be a dream of helping the community that surrounds them.
In political parties, integrity of members are the most basic thing because it is that that is able to destroy the party's development, even so it can hold the authority to lead the government.
Members as it is not integrity and they think that there are followers who can destroy their party's victory, but when you get a election, you have been unsuccessful.
Therefore, lack of integrity in the party is a dangerous issue because the party can think many followers and yet the real situation is not available.
It is a primary thing to members to have integrity in their party and to make sure they don't know the same way even in any other ways.
Integrity of the party, the chairperson of the union of parents of the Revolutionary Party (CCM) Abdallah Bulembo said that soon that there are members who are a brother in the party.
Bulembo who is a member of the executive committee of CCM speaking with students from universities who are followers of the party in Zanzibar town said that there is a party members which he changed as CUF.
That leader who led the campaign to make the victory of President John Magufuli in the Tanzania general elections that took place on October 25th, 2015, said that issue is bad.
Bulembo urging CCM members to be careful and to make sure that they be able to maintain the party and to evade them in his responsibilities.
It is possible that Kerry can be there because such as that leader he would be able to say something that he has not heard of it.
In the fact, the issue of love, Milele FM, is not a new issue in politics, but it is bad and that does not depend on all community activities.
Despite promising to talk about his CCM party, but that issue of not having faith in the party is not supposed to be careful in any political party.
Therefore, it is good for people who have decided to come out to support a certain party that they do not have the responsibility of their hearts and they should not be avoided, so as to bring development of political parties and make sure there are peace and calmness in the country.
Acts of violating the instructions of the party or be used by another party and affect your party, it is not easy to understand that it can endanger the peace.
It is good if any person told me he cannot be honest in his party which he decided to join him without having any political party because there is no mistake.
However, the condition of that in the afternoon becomes a sheep, but the night goes on the skin of a patient is a dangerous thing and it can even lose your life.
Politics have political fanaticism and there are other people who can endure if they make acts of fulfilling their party and they have not noticed that, so in a good environment that can be avoided, there is a result of some people who want the Civic United Front (CUF) to be abolished by claims that it will maintain peace and endanger the country's peace.
Those who gave those allegations in some of the politicians who claim that CUF has been causing citizens to check up to the Revolutionary Government of Zanzibar (UNBoA) and not with it.
Before the general elections of Zanzibar, that was canceled as CUF was cooperating with CCM to form the national government (SUK) that led Zanzibar for five years since the year 2010.
However, the national union was fouled after the repeat of the Zanzibar elections that has been boycotted by CUF and its results put him in power to the government of CCM.
Apart from that can take the second election that it hasn't broken the current election that was not been reached by CCM and CUF who missed the state of peace in the country and to eliminate violence that caused between the followers those parties.
The right time of Zanzibar between CCM and CUF appeared to be reached after the agreement between the former President of Zanzibar and the vice chairperson of CCM Zanzibar, Doctor Amani Abeid Karume and the secretary general of CUF, Maalim Seif Shariff Hamad.
The breakup of the political division of Zanzibar and the state of hostility, by citizens is back afresh, where some of the people of Zanzibar are playing in providing community services such as swept off the products.
In the current situation, the thoughts of wanting to reach the CUF is not a solution to problems that are present in Zanzibar.
In any way, even you will not depend on the political parties to decide it to know the CUF does not mean that the situation will make Zanzibar be safe.
There is no doubt that CUF followers if their party will be wanted to join the party that depends on CCM party.
However, without doubt, those followers can support another party or they will make a new party and a situation continued as usual and they added the opposition to the ruling party.
In that view, it is good for all those with thoughts as CUF to be allowed to find those thoughts as they do not have any contribution in removing the political division that is in Zanzibar.
If there is an assurance that it is good for the politicians of Zanzibar to think afresh and to look for alternative ways to end the political conflict in Zanzibar.
The Democratic Party for sure that it can bring peace and calmness in the country is to ensure that everything is done by considering the basis of justice.
It is a must that every event in the country should be taking place because of injustice to some people or to stop bias against some people.
