Tunduru district, Ruvuma province has set aside a special time in court to hear cases and issues concerning men who impregnate primary and secondary students.
that was said at the weekend by the District Commissioner Juma Homera while speaking to students and parents of the Masonya Girls' Secondary School at the 11th graduation of form four students of that school.
Homera stated that it is evident the drop in performance among many girls in secondary schools in that district is contributed by the female students engaging in love affairs and thereby failing to concentrate on their studies.
he said, in order to stop this, he urges the court department to conduct cases of suspects charged for impregnating students at the ward level in order to speed up the hearing of the cases by helping the witnesses not to go far as well as avoid case taking a long time as others are completed after the time for graduating from school has already elapsed.
in addition, the district commissioner congratulated the teachers of that school for offering high quality education and enabling the school to lead at the regional level and being among top 100 schools in the nation in the form six examination last year, and he urged the form four students to set a record of ousting the fourth grade.
earlier, welcoming the guest of honor, head of the school, Elice Banda has urged parents to provide their students with all the basic needs in order to avoid being lured to received aid from 'benefactors'.
she said that the school has 533 female students from form one to six, and it is experiencing an accommodation shortage as a result of the dormitories being unable to satisfy their large numbers.
