We would like to answer the questions that we receive about the consecutive killings in Gubat and Prize today, Sorsogon this past two weeks.

First, the revolutionary movement in the said incident does not have anything to do with their own investigation to solve the no meaning of this crime, we have information that this is related to the sale of illegal drugs.
We have a particular interest in the case of Federico Emanuel a (who was killed last October 4) and Jinky was killed last October 11) because they were killed last October 11) because they did not received reports about the involvement of the officials and soldiers of the Philippine Army for illegal drugs.

It is possible that the murder of October 15 to Alan Fisheries Code of Barangay Panganiban, Gubat, Gubat, Cavite had the same style of those who were riding the motorcycle and were armed with debts and a caliber .45 caliber.

Whatever it is, we want to send to the families of the victims that they can ask for help from us from what they can give and solve the information that they can give in order to push our investigation and open justice for the victims.
