more than 100 drivers have been identified having fake license drivers in Tarime and Rorya districts in Mara.
after the ongoing police investigation, most of the drivers with fake licenses have packed the cars they were driving but some drive them at night...
head of the traffic police squad, Tarime/Rorya Region, Joseph Bukombe said they have examined more than 100 drivers' licenses and identified they are not in the computer system of the Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA).
in addition to discovering that, they also discovered they have not been trained on driving at the Vocational Educational and Training Authority institute or those recognized.
Bukombe said, "we have identified drunk drivers, who have fake licenses, who do not comply with the road safety act, including speeding.
lack of fire extinguishers and insurance and encouraging and educating passengers to give information to the relevant agencies as soon as they discover their driver is drunk or driving at a speed that endangers their lives.
he said the drivers are riding small passenger cars between towns and villages of Sirari to Tarime, Nyamongo to Tarime, Nyamwaga to Tarime, Mugumu to Tarime, Utegi to Tarime and Tarime to Shirati and Utegi to Kinesi.
he said they have reports that drivers have left their cars and are driving them at night, and wanted them to know that an honest work is sustainable and demanded those with fake licenses to study in Veta so as to get rid of stubbornness as legal action will be taken against them.
