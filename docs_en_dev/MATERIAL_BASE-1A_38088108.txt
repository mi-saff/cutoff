I would like Jerry Muro, quickly I would have written this.
Last week, the Citizen newspaper team did a interview with Yanga's chairperson, Yusuf Manji as only two days after being elected to hold that position in the club for a period of four years according to the constitution.
In that interview, Manji spoke about various development issues and advice to the sports sector, politics and economy and to give a directive.
He said that the revenue decreased since people were waiting to look for the ball and also in their branches and Manji said it is good for the Tanzania Football Federation (TFF) to remain with their contract with Azam and to talk about how many shillings for every match can pay them.
Manji went on more by saying that it has caused a reduction of fans of fans to go to the field and to reduce the club's income.
Also, he complained about the ones that were affected by the system of selling equipment like the jerseys, a gun and strong winds up to be a problem because they are making equipment with Yanga logo and use them to benefit themselves instead of the club.
He said that in a large extent, Yanga has got a loss and forced him to increase 25 billion shillings to achieve different things to win the premier league championship, the FA Cup, participation in the Champions League to the Federation Cup.
Now, together with Manji, he said in an interview, it is possible that it was known inside Yanga that there is a loss that was found and a reduction in revenue.
As a result of that situation, what should be done soon, a human being used to make holes in these matches of the Federation Cup because it has already been found.
In that state, I were the information officer of Yanga, Jerry Muro whom I would have made this opportunity to take place on first September when I would have advised the executive committee to manage this income that will be sold for special people because of contributing to Yanga and there is a ticket for the match.
The card would have been sold maybe by 1 million shillings or more that it would have benefited as food or drinks and cold drinks, and it is in a special area.
Secondly, I would have read the procedure of entries that for being involved in the competition is the cost, those with the capacity of their team, only there are people who have pain with their team, just like that, other areas can be a special service according to the funds of the people in that area.
The area of all, here the entrance can be 10,000 shillings, I know it will be very high, but it is known, entertainment, and even international matches, the entrance fee is expected to reach 10 million.
Third, the time you will get people to sit at the stadium for those funds?
Four that are in Mara, after going back, I would set up a voice of players and send to the radio, when you sing them, then he says he wants to encourage fans, even the coach and those that do not know Swahili, I would have a great secret of their statements.
Five days for a different day, I would have made meeting with journalists to explain the strategy of Yanga, together with being defeated, the direction is short and why they have been supported.
The last meeting would have enabled today Monday, because tomorrow it is to write Yanga who plays for TP Mazembe, great news, I know what I will be done, the procedure to enter and everything concerning a match, including with special cards and other cards.
Six as I had asked the leadership of Yanga to request the sponsors, Tanzania Breweries Limited (TBL) to hold 'road show' yesterday Sunday, Monday and tomorrow, Tuesday, Temeke, Ilala and Kinondoni to encourage people not to come to the field.
.
So, until now, I have not arrived at the field but it is not for this match only.
You're very much but for the seven days, I believe that I will welcome him to Manji and his leadership and I have fulfilled my responsibility as information officer spreading them to promote the match and good of the club for the benefit of the club for the benefit of the club.
