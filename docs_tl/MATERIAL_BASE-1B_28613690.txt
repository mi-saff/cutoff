The "kristo" was repeated again as the task of a famous face and rules inside the 9th Infantry Division Philippine Army and the entire calamity that was sent to Camp SK Pendatun in Pili, Camarines Sur.

Even if the last "hidden" was tortured, which came out of social media this past few days, in one training camp or incident in any gathering of 9th ID, Kabikolan, which is being stabbed in the awareness of the arson of or soldiers to conduct a shy fight against any enemy.
It is not surprising that there will be an data that reached 111 cases of extrajudicial killings that majority have passed through a serious injury before it was killed from the year 2010 to 2014 under 16,232, the number of civilians, according to human rights.

On the part of the revolutionary movement, a higher management of Bagong Hala Bayan (BHB) should remember those who were arrested and put in situations where the hostages are arrested and put in situations that cannot be punished, aside from those who have proven to be punished for immediate death.

It was proven in many experiences, that the Bagong Hunan Bayan is honest in many times and cases of having hostages by Filipino soldiers, more opportunities in favor and release of hostages by 1st Lieutenant.

So, we call for all the youth children of farmers, workers and other type who are oppressed in the society to stand on your own kind of interest to use intelligence, courage and ability to progress the public and the impending change that's being experienced in the present.

For the soldiers who are children of physical sweat, there is a good thing left in their hearts and skill, turn your back to the service of the girl who is taking advantage and taking advantage of our parents.

Long live the revolution!
