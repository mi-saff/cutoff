Hahaha!: Humalig).
Baba Perez, 18, 2016, Philippines Sports Commission chairman William "Butch" Ramirez has a chance to focus on looking for their own homes to be focused on to those foreign coach or athletes.
According to Ramirez, he is not against a Fil-foreign policy or his coach, but it is really good that it is good that the athletes will win the gold medal for the International Airport for the Philippines.
To execute this thing, it will be better for his agency to focus on the National Youth games, Batang at the Philippine National Orthopedic Hospital and other competition in order to find someone who has a relative, Ramirez, which is discovered in Mindanao region.
Isn't it that the coach of Hagupin are all pure Filipinos?
According to Ramirez, why is it that foreign coach can even get along if the local coach is focusing on the program that the foreign coach is presented.
As of now, the PSC is already paid for the foreign coaches due to $1,500 to $3,000 (equivalent to P75,000 pesos to 150 pesos per month).
Ramirez said that instead of going to the people from different countries, why won't it be given to our fellowmen coaches.
According to the PSC, he will give up to 100,000 pesos salary in a Filipino coach depending on the performance of his athletes.
That is why in our coach who is silent and there in the corners of the corner, you will find it out, it is time to go out, it is hard to go out of your skills and knowledge in making a athletes right for the honor of our "Iya"

But, wait, Ramirez said there is also a warning from the local government coach that those who are pleading should always fix their job because they are in danger.
