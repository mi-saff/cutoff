police are searching for the owner of the building that killed 14 Nairobi
Nairobi
Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta has ordered the arrest of the owner of the apartment that collapsed and killed 14 people last week.
President Kenyatta also asked residents of the houses near the area to leave because they have been proven unsafe.
Kenyan government said the building had no human living permit, so the police asked the owner of the building to surrender after President Kenyatta ordered the arrest.
Red Cross society said the death rate has reached 14 people.
other 134 injured people were evacuated from the bundles by civilians and handmade crew to do the job.
rescuers said they could hear sounds of five people inside the building walls.
President Kenyatta visited the area of the incident.
last year, Kenyatta ordered a security audit of all buildings in Kenya.
the National Construction Authority found 58 percent of buildings in the capital Nairobi are not quality as the Government says some builders violate the law to finalize the construction projects quickly due to the increase in home business.
until now the rescue unit still continues to search for people who are alleged to be covered by the remains of the building that collapsed.
