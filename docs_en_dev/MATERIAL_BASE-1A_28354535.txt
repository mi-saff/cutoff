Education through the picture of the nation, introduction of people.
28th of 5, 2015.

I have given an example of how many people are careful, they are determined to invest in education of their children and even if it is a family that will help their children and to give them everything that will inform their children and to give them everything that will make better upbringing and efficiency.
This means that they will ensure that children get a good place to go to the right, clean, accommodation, food, food and enough food, the body against diseases which will enable them to be careful in their lives.
Then, education education is together with the good upbringing that get children in the households that they were not born, in the village or in the village or in school, the school has become an agent of the family and the community of the village or area or the area to grow up because of its borders.
The parents and family members are fulfilling their responsibilities until their end, the community members in the village and in the streets have expressed their responsibilities until they get married, and the child is going to school where the responsibility of the continuation of education and upbringing of the child is received by teachers and other servants of that education sector.
Starting from a family, village, neighborhood to schools and college, all of this is the continuation of the main activity of bringing up and creating a community member who will be able to have its own benefits, to his family and even the whole country, and even the whole country, and even the whole world.
Therefore, what is the way we found in teachers with qualifications, are trusted by public servants who had been improved, leaders who left their points in the community, the defending champions everything that is good and their opponents for each other in the world.
If you read the high level (story) of people's life like people's fate it Jawaharlal Nehru, Julius Nyerere, Nelson Mandela, Nelson Mandela, Martin Luaga, Nelson Mandela, Nelson Mandela, and those acts were seen from the way they were stolen from early marriages.
(For those who wants to follow up on this, there are many political books here in the country and in neighboring countries, Europe, United States and Asia which wrote on how the senior leaders don't be educated about.
Lubuvu has come in details about the environment that he is (right), a culture that brought up training from mother and other family members, with the content of its own education, education and later in school, all of them were one of the knowledge, skills, education and even so that he used to get to his death.
Contrary to you, you will agree with the qualifications that are against the ones that I explained by many children who were born and cut off from the elderly and corruption, they have not been lucky enough to take him on his wealth, but it has never been a person to marry off them.
The same way for a child that is born and cut off in the environment of conflict and conflicts in the family or in the village or in every village where he is with a conflict that will make it, that is why there is true you will make it, that is why there is true you will make it, that is why there are the truth when there is a fox which doesn't know if they are found with the behavior of those guardians.
Therefore, it is very important for the upbringing of the children of any nation to be prepared and supervised by stable for a extent that is possible in education and training, behavior of people in the nation to deal with the danger of making the country not to have a habit of being taxed.
I have ever asked, and until now I think this is something that depends on how to protect our children because it is wrong, integrity and brutality which are bad, corruption, tension and hypocrisy?
