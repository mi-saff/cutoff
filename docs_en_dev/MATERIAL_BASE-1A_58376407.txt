Last week, my friends of you come out to visit together with them part of the city of Shanghai, South Korea in the district of Guebuza.
This area has been sponsored by South Korea because a big percentage of if they go to them here Shanghai, they live in this place, and so on, there are a lot of business that you go to.
In loam soil in the streets of eternal life, they will be announced by the biggest number of the Chinese who came for purposes of getting different entertainment including food, drinks and different attractions for the culture of the country.

What I'm looking for what I understood is that the culture of Korea bought China for a long distance in the restaurants in food, big shops and most of the Chinese are required to vote on the front of the examples of famous artists in the country then it is enough evidence.

The effects have also spread in the computer games and the success is that in the culture of culture and art, it is dangerous to avoid the desire of tourists to visit the country.
I have heard that you learn a good work and it has also been made now.

The wave of spread and the growth of the art and culture in the country did not start soon in the year 2001, media stations benefited from the wave, "Hallana, (or Hallana).
