For this difficult work, Lukuvi has to be remembered, he cannot go.
The land sector in the country for now is growing up in great changes, where the value of that value has been increasing every day.
There is a probability that there are few people who know well about the real value of land which is a big place it has been postponed since independence.
If you want to know the real value of land, try to do investment, be private in that sector, then you will see and without doubt, he was surprised.
In urban and rural areas, the land is a resources that is being dealt with again by a large extent, it has been the source of reasons for many conflicts and sometimes even disasters, people have play, others have lost permanent disabilities.
Different from maybe the time of the previous phase, the land has been given a new view, we want him to see his minister, William Lukuvi and his assistant, Angelina Mabula and his assistant, Angelina Mabula and his assistant, Angelina Mabula.
-shirt, I could make an opportunity to give an award or a medal to the minister that performed well in the year 2016, there is no doubt that Lukuvi has been sold to the first.
I would like you sell, without doubt, although it is not all, although it is not all, because they have refused to say the fact that every time we had told me, is one among the close relatives of President John Magufuli who is no doubt.
It is possible for the land owners, including the leaders, which the club has reduced, they are using them, some of them have done land, some of them are required to promote, otherwise he will go with the water!
The leaders, including the local governments, the villages in the country will be forced to listen to him because of rebuking the weapons to sit on their revenue sources.
Haazu taking them in many areas in the city, including Dar es Salaam, if you remove it in a few areas that were put up and requested not to be forced, who have been forced to.
I understand that we have participated in one way or another in the allocation of land, plots or farms which owners are meeting with conflicts.
Others I believe that they are forced to say that they are not happy and we are looking for plots and farms.
Some of them started the pockets of the pockets of the pockets of their differences, although their days have been released last.
Some of them carried out the customers who wanted to land for their own kind.
Also, experts, including land plans, land officers, before the arrival of Lukuvi had a lesson so as to make them get married and these days have gone to small.
Some of them were living in the grave, they saw them in land or documents of land disputes, farms, documents which made many years to receive, although these days I am told to do that is not allowed.
If I have explained earlier, the land sector is cutting and supervised by the ministry, many laws, has been having conflicts, conflicts since the country gets its independence during the past 55 years ago because of land conflicts did not end?
Few who benefited from, including the scholars, including the scholars that sell the real value of land, it brought down or for buying, later they sell it through the local governments, villages and 83 households, some of them are young people.
That wealth is available through land, which we have learned that they are public property, should follow me behind many conflicts that I have been told the region of Lake is leading in the country.
Both buyers of plots or farms for many years have lost, although they see light.
Its results, the sector seemed a nuisance to many citizens, who wanted to invest in one way or another.
Many years later, land which is a very human resources have continued to remove many people up to today, everyone has invested in the sector with mental disabilities, we will make sure you know what our children are trusted, we will let us know what our children are in the coming century?
The answer to this question is to set up today, I wish all our responsibility as a community to start doing land for a new view than it is now when we see the country and the whole country to solve a lot of land problems in urban and rural areas, we think he does not want to do.
I would like to urge him, who my friend since the same time when we meet at Morogoro road, not to be afraid but they should not depend on that sector on the new view, should not depend on how to change some of the laws facing that sector.
I advise that the issue of getting documents for every owner's land, plot or land in urban and rural areas have been fed a new view, because if they use reports that are available in these days easily from the public authorities, National Identification Authority (Nida), the National Electoral Commission (NEC) or Rita so as to enable all owners of land to get documents.
The system of assessing the ownership of different levels will be looked at afresh so as to enable land to be resources that will help protect themselves and borrow the bank or financial institutions that are believed to be taken as they are now.
My advice is to be looked upon in the law of that sector, to eliminate bureaucracy and great authority to some people, including leaders and executives of the sector, that needs the national debate.
I don't want to believe that the issue to prepare and provide documents for plots or farms will happen to land in state house or in the regional offices to be able to help them get documents so as to help them get quick documents so as to help them get quick documents.
In hand with that, the use of land business, the construction of huge buildings that will be done in great speed in the country, is also its laws to be looked at afresh so that the land tax and buildings of that council should be beneficial to the country.
