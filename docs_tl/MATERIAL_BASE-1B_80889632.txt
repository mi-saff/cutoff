Our soldiers are waiting for a long time.

Postigo.

Filipino soldiers.

On patrol, June 3, 2013.

It would be a good mason.

This is a combat that can be shown in order to show the skills of every soldier of their country using the services of their country using a gathering of combat that is being prepared, and training to cross the combat that's being implemented, and a small training of practice.

Meanwhile, we are in place at the International Criminal Court Champbell, one of them!

The said competition and commerce at the United States, great Britain, Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia, Indonesia, China, and many others, will come out from different trials that will come from different kinds of guns, standard for different kinds of guns, standard for their armed forces.

Because of this, it is really good to become a Filipino! Our government soldiers are like that!
