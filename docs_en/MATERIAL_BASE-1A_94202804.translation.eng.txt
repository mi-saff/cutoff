union of the youth of the party of the revolution (UVCCM), Kagera Province have complained over the action done by the leaders of the party of democracy and development (Chadema) of using the disaster of the earthquake here in the town to do politics and misleading propaganda.
also, that union has asked and advised the government to leave the work of analysis, distribution of all aid to the affected to be done by Tanzania People's Defense Force (TPDF).
the UVCCM acting Secretary General, Shaka Hamdu, explained that issue to the Kagera Provincial Commissioner, Salum Kijuu when he visited him in his office.
he told him that what Chadema is doing is a disgraceful and unusual event.
he said some leaders from the party, are using that earthquake to try and build themselves politically while discriminating members of CCM on political ideologies.
he said that the verification and initial issuance of aid were done when there was discrimination and favoritism while some of the aid shipment and construction material were written "you got together".
