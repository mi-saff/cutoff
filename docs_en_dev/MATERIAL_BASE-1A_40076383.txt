The parliamentary committee of constitution continues to consider the views of the citizens.
APR of 03 / 2014.

The special constitutional parliament is in its seventh week out of 10 that were given previously, and it's this week that is where he has been given a chance to officially open the draft constitution with an important document that you missed to the delegates of that parliament, to use a new constitution.

The days that are remaining for the purpose of discussing that document was very few than used in making regulations that will lead the parliamentary debates, and even if it will be 20 years, according to the law, may not be able to complete that hard work.

It's not our aim being considered for a long time been used to make the regulations of running the delegates, because there are identifying the importance of the presence of a stable regulations, even if there are there which have already started using and we do not want to say that the long time has not been enough.

We are saying that it is important for more important during this period of discussing the draft, it is to delegates to consider the views of the citizens, that is what other citizens do not want to be in their constitution, for their benefit to their own life and of generations to come.

We are not the first to give this call and we will not be the end to do that, but we have no need to continue urging the delegates to consider the views of the citizens because in many debates, I have been witnessed from Dodoma, many delegates seem to be pumped by the opinion polls of their parties.

Examples are many, big and open doors are the one to decide the type of votes that I have been used in passing the draft constitution, a small issue, but it has distributed the delegates in the whole issue without caring what the citizens want from them.

However, the regulations should be careful about who is between the president and the chairman of the Constitutional Review Commission is supposed to be first to address the parliament for political ideology and such attitude.

And now there are all signs of existence of blood from outside parliament after leaders of the political parties that are outside Dodoma province to start the journey to visit the whole country to encourage citizens to support the coalition system that is required by the concerned party.

When we ask you, this means that these visit will help address the constitutional parliament because the government has no ability to move forward, but the parliament does not have the ability to be left immediately in this private tour can be filled with feelings of violence among local dances.

Further, most of them know that time to give opinions about the constitutional changes was brought and ended and ended up, for now, is the turn for the delegates of the Constitutional Assembly to discuss the time when they finish the draft which was made in Dodoma.

Now, "ghost workers" have been taken to the citizens at this time when their opinion didn't be able to put in the draft that is in Dodoma it is true that if it is not knowing free of diabetes, the only thing that transported their views.

That is why we would like to tell members to discuss the draft without blood from Dodoma or their parties, but by considering the opinions of the citizens and especially what are on the documents they are following the draft constitution, the constitution of the United Republic of Tanzania and the one of Zanzibar.
