We will wait to get a yellow card.
Likewise, especially those who live outside the country with the yellow fever disease are required to come out in different stations provided by the Ministry of Health, Social Development, Gender, the Elderly and Children for the purpose of getting the vaccination together with changing the new certificates.
Those have been said today by the Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Doctor Charles Mwijage when he arrived to get the yellow fever vaccine which is given in parliament.
Minister Mwijage said that this disease is there and there are many countries which have lost its citizens by suffering from the disease, "therefore, this is very important to our health, together with that our country does not have a yellow fever patient.
Furthermore, he has said the infection of this disease if a person will be a lot of treatment is very expensive and can be able to lose lives, therefore it is good to come out in large numbers to get the vaccination as well as to change their cards because they do not get into their lives.
However he warned business people, those who live or study outside the country is good to ensure they get the vaccination to another way because these cards have been improved and have secret marks that international countries have the ability to study our points.
And the member of parliament of Ilala region, Doctor Mussa Zungu has congratulated the ministry of health, community development, gender, the elderly and children by using the new cards by using many certificates that were bought at the market without getting medical tests and therefore getting certificates that are legal.
Ministry of Health, Social Development, Gender, the Elderly and Children has added the time to change the old certificates until the end of this month and after that old certificates will not be allowed again.
I thank Catherine Addison, the president of Dodoma.
