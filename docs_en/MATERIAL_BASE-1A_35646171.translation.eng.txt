Sumaye reminds of Mkapa
June 04, 2015
former prime minister, Frederick Sumaya has said all the ministers who were in the council of ministers of the third phase government are responsible for all the decisions made then.
Raia Mwema has been told that in its meeting with the media that was arranged to take place in Dar es Salaam yesterday, Sumaye shall explain that there is no minister who can refuse to be part of the decision when he did not resign his position then.
some of confusing decisions of the third phase government were selling of state houses to servants, buying a plane for the president and a radar to guide the plane which all arose a discussion that time.
"everything that sparked discussions while I was the prime minister were done in agreement inside the council of ministers.
no minister can say he did not hear.
"I will be surprised if there is anyone who will come to say he did not participate in the decisions made when he was in the council that decided and he did not resign to disagree," said Sumaye.
Sumaye was expected to talk to the media yesterday to announce his aim of running for presidency in Tanzania through CCM.
for a period of ten years of president Benjamin Mkapa's reign, Sumaye was the prime minister and till now, he is the one with a history of holding that position for the longest time than all the others since Tanzania became independent.
because he was the succeeding minister, some of his political opponents can decide to bring down more blame on him and his explanations have an aim of answering those kinds of beatings that will emerge.
together with those challenges, Sumaye will also use that opportunity to explain his success he found at that time that gives him more qualifications of succeeding president Jakaya Kikwete than his opponents.
some of the qualities are knowing the country and its needs well, the ability to raise the economy, integrity and experience in leadership.
