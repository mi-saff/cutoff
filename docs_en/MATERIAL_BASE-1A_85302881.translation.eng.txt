welcome keep staying with us .
thank you so much Shaaban Kisu .
so you have left us two questions .
the first question you have asked do Tanzanians identify ourselves as Tanzanians and we know Swahili to make us be look like Tanzanian Saidi if you went out today and met a person what will identify you as a Tanzanian ?
definitely it is Swahili .
it is very true it is Swahili language .
we particularly take that question to you .
is Swahili a mark to identify a Tanzanian ?
for any country to be known one of the identifiers is language but this identifier does not identify us well and it is not a national identifier because if you go into the parliament I think everything is understood .
<no-speech>
these are who when they especially come to our home do not speak English .
if you go to courts judgment is written in English .
so why are we doing this here ?
there is a tricky person who has come from a distance and has ruled us from many parts .
<no-speech>
like our reporter said eh mister Shabaan Kisu that people deny even their nationality even insulting his mother and father that I -- you were wrong to have had that look .
so the enemy has started there .
<no-speech>
he has turned us around he has destroyed our dressing our systems we have reached a point where we cannot call Swahili a national mark .
therefore we have every reason we who are available to see that things are moving and take back Swahili be a national mark thank you .
I agree that language is ones identity .
anyone is identified by his language because language carries a large percentage of a person's culture .
but it is true that we Tanzanians are so much identified by Swahili but I am surprised we have so many institutions established and are paid our money from our tax but we do not see if they are working to -- to protect and fight for -- the destruction of our Swahili language .
for example we have B_A_K_I_T_A we have T_U_K_I the media is involved in destroying our Swahili language but we do not see them taking any step in correcting or using the media -- I would like to say that the issue of Swahili -- eh Swahili has become a mark .
<no-speech>
it is a mark and our national identity .
but (()) to be honest is it a mark or our identity ?
<no-speech>
because we do not value it from the least level .
<no-speech>
maybe we could have said this Swahili is a mark from primary level because it is a language for teaching and it is a language of communication .
but if you get to secondary school and universities it is a subject .
therefore I would like to ask the media our systems and politicians to use Swahili in all fields .
when a representative of a certain country comes to Tanzania they mostly like to use their language because there is an interpreter that when an interpreter is available maybe in English to interpret for the citizens to understand him .
but when it happens that a Tanzanian leader goes to a different country from Tanzania he finds himself speaking English when interpreters are also available .
therefore I think also in the universities this course for interpretation should extended so that when it happens that a leader from Tanzania to another country be accompanied by his interpreter to interpret to those of that country so that they understand but we should use our language as our Tanzanian identity thank you .
so thank you so much our intellectuals for different ideas . so straight away let's go and prepare a grand debate so that we get different ideas in relation to our debate .
I am so much aware that Swahili language is a mark of our country but I beg to answer in be it in a little more advanced knowledge .
<no-speech>
that even if you took Fanon's writing in one of the books he wrote the Black Skin White Masks that there are some black people but have covered themselves in white masks .
<no-speech>
but if you go to Caribbean you will find a guy called George Lamming and many others who kept on dispersing the likes of Albert Memmi .
<no-speech>
all these talk about the importance of language .
<no-speech>
but if you come to Tanzania or Eastern Africa you will find a guy called Ngugi Gerishon who speaks of a person who denies a language as a person similar to the one who lives in a dirty pool because he does not understand himself .
<no-speech>
and we have examples .
