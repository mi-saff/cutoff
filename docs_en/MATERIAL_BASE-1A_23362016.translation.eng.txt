Diamond Platinum bashes the National Arts Council -BASATA
Diamond Platnumz has castigated the National Arts Council BASATA for rolling back Tanzanian music by not permitting the introduction of other music awards in the country, aside from Kilimanjaro Music Awards. while speaking at the XXL program on Clouds FM today, Diamond said that this action makes him feel that there is a hidden agenda in that council.
"why do we have only one award in Tanzania, it's something that saddens me very much because if you look at even other small countries, we are musically superior but they have more than one award," Diamond questioned.
"I do not know what is going on in BASATA".
he said if there could be a variety of music awards in the country, there would be positive challenge to the organizers of those awards rather than as it is now whereby KTMA has no rival.
"if there are various awards they will learn from others but if there is only one thing every day, then it's just done".
on the other hand, Diamond said after the Kili nominations were out, he could not comment on anything since he saw that he had been put in categories that he did not deserve.
"if you look keenly if I was not in any category at all how then can I be the best male artist, under what criteria?" he questioned.
"now you're telling me that I do not have the characteristics of a member of parliament, councilor, minister, do not have those characteristics and then you make me compete for the presidency now, how will I win then if we can't at the beginning?"
"I saw, you know what, I'd better be keep quiet, I did not want to speak because they're not late to interpret you differently, that is why I was not there in those days, to be completely honest".
