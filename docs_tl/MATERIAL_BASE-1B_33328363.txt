Earnest greetings to you!
July 4, 2016 with almost an extraordinary reaction, is Wilfred Uytengsu, is always calm from his child, Calvin Abueva, Gilas Pilipinas.
In the middle of the fierce opposition of many of the decision of coach Tab Baldwin 'decision to remove Abueva, who is just pretending to be Wilfred Uytengsu, the boss of Abueva, Alaska.
"What we want is to always be followed," Wilfred Uytengsu, "my support in Gilas well, but this is a pure love for the country, but this is a pure love for the country, but this is not a desirable love for the country.", "yes," the answer of Uytengsu, "yes."
"We are all supported in Gilas well," Wilfred Uytengsu, "good player, Abueva, and we are happy with him and for Team Philippines."
Before, Wilfred Uytengsu is very cruel when it comes to things that are controversial, similar to the case of Abueva.
I was almost not able to talk to anyone who was not angry at the removal of Abueva, as well as the reaction to the departure of La Tenorio 11, sick.
"Although our heart was crushed, we are still proud of Abueva who took care of her calmness due to the events," says Wiltshire.
It's as if I did not know Wilfred Uytengsu, from going back to a sheep.
Everything really changed.
