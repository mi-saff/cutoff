education stakeholders in the Shinyanga Region have commended the government for establishing a well-known "equip" education program that has helped improve the level of education here.
the stakeholders who are Education officials, Ward Education Coordinators and experts involved in implementing Education Development have said that the 'equip Tanzania' Program has greatly contributed to increasing the level of education in the curriculum due to the reduction of existing challenges, including poor parent and teacher cooperation.
they were talking during a specialized training provided by 'equip' in Kahama district in Shinyanga Ward for building capacity to communicate and exchange information on implementation results.
the stakeholders have commended the program by establishing a partnership with parents and teachers popularly known as the UWW.
they said that this unity has made teachers and parents closer and tracked their children's academic development and learning environment where some schools have been able to provide lunch, which has contributed to increased success.
giving an example of Mwenge primary school the City Planning coordinator in Shinyanga Municipality, Zezema Shilungushela, said that other achievements include parents understanding their role in contributing to school development, for example, establishing school development projects and having a good relationship between teachers, parents and communities.
besides, the stakeholders have thanked the government for recognizing them and providing them with instruments of work, especially motorcycles for the ward education coordinator, which helped them in following up on program implementation and parent education even though there are still challenges in some of the areas parents not understanding and claiming allowances for sittings to discuss the development of the school.
