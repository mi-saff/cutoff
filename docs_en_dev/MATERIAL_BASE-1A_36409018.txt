Karume "wrote me," said his painful truth about the 29th of 29, 2012

This article will follow my evaluation about the 8 general meeting of CCM that took place in Dodoma since November 11 up to November 14th this year.

Since the Party of Revolution (CCM) is a party of five party, they're blocking him in people and believe that every after the general meeting, CCM should be born afresh.

This faith has been reduced due to the fact that, before the general meeting, there are some symptoms of the scandal, there are several cases of groups wanting the agenda to stop.

As a result of control of state agencies together with tickets to listen to them, those plans are stuck on and make many people believe that CCM has themselves and those of them are doing it to be accountable every after the general meeting!

The history of this concept is long, and victims (right) of this strategy for the recent years is Shafii Dauda, Samuel Sitta, Doctor Mohammed Gharib Bilal, Samuel Sitta and now Edward Lowassa.

In the previous years the lady Aboud Jumbe and Sharif Hamad, because of the open reasons, this strategy of giving the new life of CCM does not affect the people of Zanzibar more than it was done.

President Karume and "flash disk" as the vice chairman who is completing his term, the retired president of Karume, where he was welcomed to give his advice on the time of closing the meeting. He gave a speech, which is currently known as a slave in the Magogoni ferry and Lumumba Street.

There was no one who expected that Karume was saying that the day of that day to the amount of chairperson Jakaya Kikwete claimed that "he has never seen he is happy to be in that amount" if he saw him that day.

Several times his speech came out by people who stopped him, and wanted them to meet with him and to sit down and to sit down and to sit together.

Mzee Joseph Butiku has remember this and has given an official letter to the chairperson Benjamin Mkapa this week to agree that they were unable to start with CHADEMA in the meeting.

When he went to a lot of them, President Karume made it to listen to the eyes and injured in the fish!
There are some that, President Karume was given a lot to each other on that day after he was given or he was not worried about it is a strong man or not for me, my important news is what he said in the minutes he was given.

Karume spoke about his card of ASP (MASACA) when he explained the purpose of ASP Masoko and asked Doctor Shein if he had his card officially (ASP), on the purpose of ASP and explaining that it is to protect the freedom of Zanzibar and its people.
That is when he removed those colleagues to give their views about the union.

And he told President Kikwete that he gave permission to each person to talk about him that he wants during the process of giving opinions of the new constitution, he explained how they have been arrested by giving their opinion about the member of parliament and member of parliament and member of parliament.

To say open even if I had gone down here in the hall while he is speaking, Karume said that most of the hours made by other honorable members are still ongoing and so much, that is not true from Karume, which is now true, "insisted and Nape Nnauye.

Kraehenbuehl has said that more than three days have not been very much for three days, natayari we were witnessing more than 2000 members committed and moved out of the venue where the chairperson officially launched and was received by delegates from the sittings that are not officially opened up by delegates, making the leaders to lose their direction and start bad direction.

It was not expected that chairman also would have entered into the trap, when he found themselves seeing their opponents and especially CHADEMA for calling me feel much, "he told Nape Nnauye not to tell Nape.

Mzee Gunnar Garbo passed away from Southern Highlands, how come CHADEMA to be a threat to CCM than corruption and bribery are not a threat in CHADEMA.
"We be afraid," that is looked for a chance to be recognized by the constitution of our party?

He said, how come the chief advisers of our party's chairman about issues of the party, not the sessions but it's the security that came up because it was a same way and many who were complaining for three days of the meeting.

Membe knows Mangula while she has raised me again.

Bernard Membe is on the position of Bernard Membe to politics of this nation in the near future, it was in a very difficult examination of his former friend Edward Lowassa got married but he was defeated by Kikwete and his family.

Kikwete encouraged him to change the schedule of voting, while his family's wife and his child (his wife) came in every corner, it should know the truth of hostility and the friendship for these people.
- Membe, Kikwete and Lowassa.

Mzee Philip Mangula, as he tried to see him as the vice chairperson of CCM Mainland, this is this one who is a group of network that made him to the State House, claimed that he was sent away from the White House and decided to fly him just after Kikwete was sworn in.

Let me be said, Benard Membe, the shivered and the cause of the natural network of the natural network, told Kikwete that Mangula gave a lot difficulty so that to be removed from the position of the secretary general of the party.

Mzee Mangula admitted later that inside CCM, the leadership is proud who came out and his voters do not want to talk about the candidates, but they want to be aired on. "
Mzee Mangula, every time he was reminded to the activities of the network, he is expecting that he was given to him and he doesn't know for a special way. "

There is the news that Mzee Mangula made him as the support of Membe saying that several sessions will be taken to Makambako and between these two and it should be by Membe to be forced, they met with the agenda, it was a elections in the general meeting of 8.

He was asked for forgiveness or he had not been asked, that now it is not the news reporter, that general meeting has given Mzee Mangula as the deputy chairperson of CCM but the benefits of his network is for the benefit of its network that he loves for 2015, it is an issue of time.

If it is true, then it will be difficult to rebuke social media inside this party is legal, for Lowassa cannot be illegal.

For those who failed, there is a work of evaluating the way they go down and decided to marry each other, it is a dream of each other to break the groups when whoever wins gets in the State House continuing with his group.
Only one thing, Mzee Mangula insisting that Honorable Membe who claimed to be afraid after the year 2005 before Kikwete, he cannot change today and he cannot change him that he is the same person who is looking for that party because that is what he has changed to Mangula is the same one!

What seems to prove that it is not true that Kikwete and when I saw it as Kikwete and when he saw him as the party's presidential candidate, Lowassa who did not get him in front of their eyes and believe that Mangula will help them to save CCM in the hands of Lowassa's presidential candidate.

The action of asking for a song "truth" and their party be able to help them to rebuild the party, it doesn't get the opportunity to assess this situation, instead we agree with each other and others that are not satisfied and we wait for another special general meeting or the year 2017.
