young man fined a he goat by elders
residents here were left gaping when Jombi was fined a he goat by the council of elders for having an intimate affair with his neighbor's wife.
the man was caught relaxing with someone's wife at three o'clock in the afternoon.
according to the source, the woman had lied to her husband that she was at the salon having her hair made.
rumors say that, instead of going to the salon she sneaked into the young man's room who is their neighbor.
"the woman after confirming no one had seen her, entered the young man's room who is their neighbor and they begun their antics," said the source.
however, she was not lucky because one woman saw her entering the young man's room and when they locked themselves inside, she looked for the husband and told him what was going on.
it is said that when the husband got the news that his wife was sharing the fruit, he decided to sneak up on them.
when he knocked on the door several times and it wasn't opened, he decided to break down the door with all his strength and entered inside.
"the man did not believe his eyes when he found the mother of his children with the young man half naked trying to get dressed."
he screamed and a crowd of people crowded the place.
"attempts by the young man to flee through the window failed and he was nabbed," said the source.
it is said that some of the residents started beating him up but he was saved by the village elder assisted by head of community policing.
an emergency meeting was organized whereby the husband of the woman forgave them but the elders fined the young man a he goat.
however, the woman fled in fear of her husband just as soon as the elders session was concluded.
up to the time of writing this news, it is not known where she went.
the husband refused to take the he goat that the young man had paid as fine, saying that he had already forgiven him and the elders sold it and shared the money.
