The rich have spoilt the environment, poor.
APR of 23rd, 2014.

I have not seen here in the country, at the end of February I expected to be a rash on the life, it will send and drought.
The situation was very different from the heavy rain and cold drinks, continues to April.
And at home where I was following up on the news of Tanzania, I see the rains that have been shaken the whole country.
These are the changes in countries that affected the whole world as a result of the environment.
So as to understand that these changes are good to look at any details, its source, to the future, its steps and actions be taken and how many roads in Dar es Salaam have met or burn in primary schools to understand that this is the destruction done by a human being.

Doctor Peter Lerner has said that who is an expert in weather in the Institute of Pindani Nyalile in the world if the amount of rains that are not normal, floods, drought, abort, and see its changes so that we can increase four times in the last 50 years. "
He says these changes have been caused by an increase of certain gas in the air like fish, climate change, which will affect the origin of a human being because for a long time industries and vehicles have spoilt due to billions of gas tons that cause an increase in income.
Scientists are worried that the increase in those gas has barred financial resources that will not be released on the world, therefore, those gas is not enough to be released into the world as a mirror of vehicle as seen in the vehicle.

The international panel of climate change (ACCC) which is needed by the United Nations has made a international report of 2,500 that came through the international meeting at the end of March this year that will take place, Japan.
The report was written by 66 experts and it was signed by 271 representatives from 115 countries, it says, "there is a new confirmation with more strength that have shown that in 50 years ago the world has increased as a result of human rights."
The report warned Ambassador, if these changes will continue then there is no country that will do. "

Many researchers know that the increase in climate is the one that causes high changes in the world.
Those are complaining about their results, there have been a big increase in north east of the world, together with drought of Asia and South Africa, we have seen how El I got the same way from the lake region and spread outside.
The executive report (CC) has given a stern warning to how changes in the country how it is causing the weather state to change so as to endanger the water sources and access to food.
Tanzania's chairperson, Dojo Janja, has said it is good if the world will look at this report so that if it will affect, then its results can endanger the community and the whole world of human beings and the country "poor." Because the fact is that the number of poor people is increasing even in countries that do not be rich.
"We are happy to say that we living in a rich country are safe and that the ones who will be affected are people of the poor country," said Pickup, and added, "need to look for Plasmodium falciparum (New York) like a small example."
In the OGP meeting, each participant is a activist Mrs Christian Bella Bird has urged rich countries to lead in preventing change in the country.
